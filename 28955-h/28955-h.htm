<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>Formerly whales were principally
taken in the North Seas: the largest
were generally found about Spitzbergen,
or Greenland, some of them measuring
ninety feet in length. At the commencement
of the hazardous enterprize
of killing whales, before they had been
disturbed by man, they were so numerous
in the bays and harbours, that when
taken the <em>blubber</em> was for the most part
boiled into oil upon the contiguous coast.</p>

<p>The <em>pure</em> oil and whale bone were
only preserved in those days; consequently
a ship could carry home the
product of a greater number of whales
than a ship of the same size now can.&mdash;Indeed,
so plentiful were the whales in
those seas, and taken with such facility,
that the ships employed, were not sufficient
to carry home the oil and bone,
and other ships were often sent to bring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
home the surplus quantity. But the
coasts of these countries, were soon visited
by ships from Denmark, Hamburgh,
and Holland, as well as from England;
and from frequently being killed in the
shoal water near the coasts, the whales
gradually receded from the shores, and
have since been found only in deeper
water, and at a much greater distance
from the land.</p>

<p>In the earlier stages of the whale fishery,
of which we are now treating, the
ships were generally on the whaling
waters, early in May, and whether successful
or not, they were obliged to
commence their return by the succeeding
August, to avoid the early accumulation
of ice in those seas. But it not
unfrequently happened, that ships procured
and returned with a cargo in the
months of June and July, making a voyage
only about three months, whereas,
a voyage to the Pacific Ocean is now
often protracted to three years!</p>

<p>Among the early whalers it was customary
to have six boats to a ship, and
six men to a boat, besides the harpooner.
What at <em>that time</em> was considered
an improved method in killing whales,
consisted in discharging the harpoon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
from a kind of swivel; but it was soon
found to be attended with too much inconvenience
to be much practised, and
the muscular arms and steady nerves of
the harpooner, have ever since performed
the daring duty, of first <em>striking</em> the
whale. The ropes attached to the harpoon,
used to be about 200 fathoms in
length, and some instances occurred,
that all the lines belonging to six boats,
were fastened together and ran out by
one whale, the animal descending in
nearly a perpendicular line from the
surface. Instead of going prepared to
bring home a ship load of <em>oil</em>, it was customary
to bring only the blubber, and
instead of trying the oil out and putting
it into casks on board, the fat of the
whale was cut up into suitable pieces,
pressed hard in tubs carried out for
the purpose, and in this situation was
the return cargo received at home.</p>

<p>Of so great consequence was the whale
fishery considered to Great Britain, that
a bounty of 40s. for every ton, when the
ship was 200 tons, or upwards, was given
to the crews of ships engaged in that
business in the Greenland seas, under
certain conditions. But this bounty
was found to draw too largely upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
treasury; and while the subject was
under discussion in the British Parliament,
in 1786, it was stated that the
sums which that country had paid in
bounties to the Greenland fishers, amounted
to 1,265,461 pounds sterling.
Six thousand seamen were employed in
that fishery, and each cost the government
&pound;13 10s. <i>per annum</i>. The great
encouragement given to that branch of
commerce, caused so large a number to
engage in it, that the oil market became
glutted, and it was found necessary to
export considerable quantities.</p>

<p>In 1786, the number of British ships
engaged in the whale fishery to Davis&rsquo;s
Strait and the Greenland seas, was 139,
besides 15 from Scotland. In 1787,
notwithstanding the bounty had been
diminished, the number of English ships
was 217, and the following year 222.</p>

<p>The charter right of the Island of
Nantucket, was bought by Thomas Mayhew,
of Watertown, of Joseph Ferrick,
steward to Lord Sterling, in 1641; and
afterwards sold to Tristram Coffin, and
his associates, who settled upon it in
1659. On the 10th of May, 1660, Sachems,
Wonnook, and Nickannoose,
for and in behalf of the nations of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
Island, in consideration of the sum of
26<i>l.</i> sterling, conveyed by deed, about
half of the Island, to the first ten purchasers,
who afterwards took in other
associates.</p>

<p>Whaling from Nantucket, was first
carried on from the shore in boats. In
1672, James Loper entered into a contract
with the inhabitants of the Island,
for the purpose of prosecuting the whale
fishery, by which it appears that James
Loper agreed to be one third in the enterprize,
and sundry other people of
the Island, the other two thirds, in every
thing connected with the undertaking.
It was further stipulated, that
for every whale killed by any one of
the contracting party, the town should
receive five shillings, and for the encouragement
of James Loper, the town
granted him ten acres of land in some
convenient situation, and liberty for the
<em>commonage</em> of three cows, twenty sheep
and one horse, with necessary wood
and water for his use, on condition that
he should follow the <em>trade</em> of whaling for
two years, build upon his land, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that the commencement
of whaling at Nantucket,
was on a very small scale, and practised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
only along the shores of the Island;&mdash;whereas,
at this time, our ships leave
no seas unexplored in pursuit of these
monsters of the deep. We might pursue
the subject through the various stages
of improvement up to this time, but
it would swell this introduction beyond
the limits designed. It is proper, however,
to observe that the present number
of ships employed in the whale fishery
from Nantucket, is about 70, averaging
about 350 tons each, and manned
by about 1500 seamen.</p>

<h2 class="padtop"><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>The Ship Globe, on board of which
vessel occurred the horrid transactions
we are about to relate, belonged to the
Island of Nantucket; she was owned
by Messrs. C. Mitchell, &amp; Co. and other
merchants of that place; and commanded
on this voyage by Thomas
Worth, of Edgartown, Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>

Coffin, do. George Comstock, seaman,
and William Lay, do.</p>

<p>On the 15th day of December, we
sailed from Edgarton, on a whaling
voyage, to the Pacific Ocean, but in
working out, having carried away the
cross-jack-yard, we returned to port,
and after having refitted and sent aloft
another, we sailed again on the 19th,
and on the same day anchored in Holmes&rsquo;
Hole. On the following day a favourable
opportunity offering to proceed to
sea, we got under way, and after having
cleared the land, discharged the pilot,
made sail, and performed the necessary
duties of stowing the anchors, unbending
and coiling away the cables, &amp;c.&mdash;On
the 1st of January 1823, we experienced
a heavy gale from N.&nbsp;W. which
was but the first in the catalogue of difficulties
we were fated to encounter.&mdash;As
this was our first trial of a seaman&rsquo;s
life, the scene presented to our view,
&ldquo;mid the howling storm,&rdquo; was one of
terrific grandeur, as well as of real
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
danger. But as the ship scudded well, and
the wind was fair, she was kept before
it, under a close reefed main-top-sail and
fore-sail, although during the gale, which
lasted forty-eight hours, the sea frequently
threatened to board us, which
was prevented by the skillful management
of the helm. On the 9th of January
we made the Cape Verd Islands,
bearing S.&nbsp;W. twenty-five miles distant,
and on the 17th, crossed the Equator.
On the 29th of the same month we saw
sperm whales, lowered our boats, and
succeeded in taking one; the blubber
of which, when boiled out, yielded us
seventy-five barrels of oil. Pursuing
our voyage, on the twenty-third of February
we passed the Falkland Islands,
and about the 5th of March, doubled
the great promontory of South America,
Cape Horn, and stood to the Northward.</p>

<p>We saw whales once only before we
reached the Sandwich Islands, which we
made on the first of May early in the
morning. When drawing in with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Island of Hawaii about four in the afternoon,
the man at the mast head gave notice
that he saw a shoal of black fish on
the lee bow; which we soon found to
be canoes on their way to meet us. It
falling calm at this time prevented their
getting along side until night fall, which
they did, at a distance of more than
three leagues from the land. We received
from them a very welcome supply
of potatoes, sugar cane, yams, cocoanuts,
bananas, fish, &amp;c. for which
we gave them in return, pieces of iron
hoop, nails, and similar articles. We
stood off and on during the next day,
and after obtaining a sufficient supply
of vegetables and fruit, we shaped our
course for Oahu, at which place we arrived
on the following day, and after lying
there twenty hours, sailed for the
coast of Japan, in company with the
whaling ships Palladium of Boston, and
Pocahontas of Falmouth; from which
ships we parted company when two
days out.&mdash;After cruising in the Japan
seas several months, and obtaining five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
hundred and fifty barrels of oil, we again
shaped our course for the Sandwich Islands,
to obtain a supply of vegetables,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>While lying at Oahu, six of the men
deserted in the night; two of them having
been re-taken were put in irons,
but one of them having found means to
divest himself of his irons, set the other
at liberty, and both escaped.</p>

<p>To supply their places, we shipped
the following persons, viz: Silas Payne,
John Oliver, Anthony Hanson, a native
of Oahu, Wm. Humphries, a black man,
and steward, and Thomas Lilliston.&mdash;Having
accommodated ourselves with
as many vegetables and much fruit as
could be preserved, we again put to
sea, fondly anticipating a successful
cruise, and a speedy and happy meeting
with our friends. After leaving Oahu
we ran to the south of the Equator,
and after cruising a short time for whales
without much success, we steered for
Fannings Island, which lies in lat. 3,&nbsp;49
N. and long. 158,&nbsp;29 W. While cruising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
off this Island an event occurred
which, whether we consider the want
of motives, or the cold blooded and obstinate
cruelty with which it was perpetrated,
has not often been equalled.&mdash;We
speak of the want of motives, because,
although some occurrences which
we shall mention, had given the crew
some ground for dissatisfaction, there
had been no abuse or severity which
could in the least degree excuse or palliate
so barbarous a mode of redress and
revenge. During our cruise to Japan
the season before, many complaints
were uttered by the crew among themselves,
with respect to the manner and
quantity in which they received their
<em>meat</em>, the quantity sometimes being
more than sufficient for the number of
men, and at others not enough to supply
the ship&rsquo;s company; and it is fair to
presume, that the most dissatisfied, deserted
the ship at Oahu.</p>

<p>But the reader will no doubt consider
it superfluous for us to attempt an
unrequired vindication of the conduct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of the officers of the Globe whose aim
was to maintain a correct discipline,
which should result in the furtherance
of the voyage and be a benefit to all
concerned, more especially when he is
informed, that part of the men shipped
at Oahu, in the room of the deserters,
were abandoned wretches, who frequently
were the cause of severe reprimands
from the officers, and in one instance
one of them received a severe
flogging. The reader will also please
to bear in mind, that Samuel B. Comstock,
the ringleader of the mutiny, was
an officer, (being a boat-steerer,) and as
is customary, ate in the cabin. The
conduct and deportment of the Captain
towards this individual, was always decorous
and gentlemanly, a proof of intentions
long premeditated to destroy the
ship. Some of the crew were determined
to leave the ship provided she
touched at Fannings Island, and we believe
had concerted a plan of escape,
but of which the perpetration of a deed
chilling to humanity, precluded the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
necessity. We were at this time in company
with the ship Lyra, of New-Bedford,
the Captain of which, had been on
board the Globe during the most of the
day, but had returned in the evening to
his own ship. An agreement had been
made by him with the Captain of the
Globe, to set a light at midnight as a
signal for tacking. It may not be amiss
to acquaint the reader of the manner in
which whalemen keep watch during the
night. They generally carry three
boats, though some carry four, five, and
sometimes six, the Globe, however, being
of the class carrying three. The
Captain, mate, and second mate stand
no watch except there is <i>blubber</i> to be
boiled; the boat-steerers taking charge
of the watch and managing the ship with
their respective boats crews, and in this
instance dividing the night into three
parts, each taking a third. It so happened
that Smith after keeping the first
watch, was relieved by Comstock,
(whom we shall call by his sir name in
contradistinction to his brother George)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and the <i>waist boat&rsquo;s crew</i>, and the former
watch retired below to their births
and hammocks. George Comstock took
the helm, and during his <i>trick</i>, received
orders from his brother to &ldquo;keep the
ship a good full,&rdquo; swearing that the
ship was too nigh the wind. When his
time at the helm had expired he took
the <i>rattle</i>, (an instrument used by whalemen,
to announce the expiration of the
hour, the watch, &amp;c.) and began to shake
it, when Comstock came to him, and in
the most peremptory manner, ordered
him to desist, saying &ldquo;if you make the
least damn bit of noise I&rsquo;ll send you to
hell!&rdquo; He then lighted a lamp and
went into the steerage. George becoming
alarmed at this conduct of his
unnatural brother, again took the <i>rattle</i>
for the purpose of alarming some one;
Comstock arrived in time to prevent
him, and with threatenings dark and diabolical,
so congealed the blood of his
trembling brother, that even had he possessed
the power of alarming the unconscious
and fated victims below, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
life would have been the forfeit of his
temerity!</p>

<p>Comstock, now laid something heavy
upon a small work bench near the cabin
gangway, which was afterwards found
to be a boarding knife. It is an instrument
used by whalers to cut the <i>blubber</i>
when hoisting it in, is about four feet in
length, two or three inches wide, and
necessarily kept very sharp, and for
greater convenience when in use, is two
edged.</p>

<p>In giving a detail of this chilling transaction,
we shall be guided by the description
given of it by the younger
Comstock, who, as has been observed,
was upon deck at the time, and afterwards
learned several particulars from
his brother, to whom alone they could
have been known. Comstock went
down into the cabin, accompanied by
Silas Payne or Paine, of Sag-Harbour,
John Oliver, of Shields, Eng., William
Humphries, (the steward) of Philadelphia,
and Thomas Lilliston; the latter,
however, went no farther than the cabin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
gangway, and then ran forward and
<em>turned in</em>. According to his own story
he did not think they would attempt to
put their designs in execution, until he
saw them actually descending into the
cabin, having gone so far, to use his own
expression, to show himself as brave as
any of them. But we believe he had
not the smallest idea of assisting the
villains. Comstock entered the cabin
so silently as not to be perceived by the
man at the helm, who was first apprised
of his having begun the work of death,
by the sound of a heavy blow with an
axe, which he distinctly heard.</p>

<p>The Captain was asleep in a hammock,
suspended in the cabin, his state
room being uncomfortably warm; Comstock
approaching him with the axe,
struck him a blow upon the head, which
was nearly severed in two by the first
stroke! After repeating the blow, he
ran to Payne, who it seems was stationed
with the before mentioned boarding
knife, to attack the mate, as soon as
the Captain was killed. At this instant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Payne making a thrust at the mate, he
awoke, and terrified, exclaimed, &ldquo;what!
what! what!&rdquo; &ldquo;Is this&mdash;&mdash;Oh! Payne!
Oh! Comstock!&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill me, don&rsquo;t;&rdquo;
&ldquo;have I not always&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Here Comstock
interrupted him, saying, &ldquo;Yes!
you have always been a d&mdash;d rascal;
you tell lies of me out of the ship will
you? It&rsquo;s a d&mdash;d good time to beg
now, but you&rsquo;re too late,&rdquo; here the mate
sprang, and grasped him by the throat.
In the scuffle, the light which Comstock
held in his hand was knocked out, and
the axe fell from his hand; but the grasp
of Mr. Beetle upon his throat, did not
prevent him from making Payne understand
that his weapon was lost, who felt
about until he found it, and having given
it to Comstock, he managed to strike
him a blow upon the head, which fractured
his skull; when he fell into the
pantry where he lay groaning until despatched
by Comstock! The steward
held a light at this time, while Oliver
put in a blow as often as possible!</p>

<p>The second and third mates, fastened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
in their state rooms, lay in their births
listening, fearing to speak, and being
ignorant of the numerical strength of
the mutineers, and unarmed, thought it
best to wait the dreadful issue, hoping
that their lives might yet be spared.</p>

<p>Comstock leaving a watch at the second
mate&rsquo;s door, went upon deck to
light another lamp at the binnacle, it
having been again accidentally extinguished.
He was there asked by his
terrified brother, whose agony of mind
we will not attempt to portray, if he
intended to hurt Smith, the other boat-steerer.
He replied that he did; and
inquired where he was. George fearing
that Smith would be immediately
pursued, said he had not seen him.&mdash;Comstock
then perceiving his brother
to be shedding tears, asked sternly,
&ldquo;What are you crying about?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am
afraid,&rdquo; replied George, &ldquo;that they will
hurt me!&rdquo; &ldquo;I <em>will</em> hurt you,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;if you talk in that manner!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the work of death was not yet
finished. Comstock, took his light into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the cabin, and made preparations for attacking
the second and third mates, Mr.
Fisher, and Mr. Lumbert. After loading
two muskets, he fired one through
the door, in the direction as near as he
could judge of the officers, and then inquired
if either was shot! Fisher replied,
&ldquo;yes, I am shot in the mouth!&rdquo;
Previous to his shooting Fisher, Lumbert
asked if he was going to kill him?
To which he answered with apparent
unconcern, &ldquo;Oh no, I guess not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They now opened the door, and Comstock
making a pass at Mr. Lumbert,
missed him, and fell into the state
room. Mr. Lumbert collared him, but
he escaped from his hands. Mr. Fisher
had got the gun, and actually presented
the bayonet to the monster&rsquo;s heart!
But Comstock assuring him that his life
should be spared if he gave it up, he
did so; when Comstock immediately ran
Mr. Lumbert through the body several
times!!</p>

<p>He then turned to Mr. Fisher, and
told him there was no hope for <em>him</em>!!&mdash;&ldquo;You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
have got to die,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;remember
the scrape you got me into,
when in company with the Enterprise of
Nantucket.&rdquo; The &ldquo;scrape&rdquo; alluded
to, was as follows. Comstock came up
to Mr. Fisher to wrestle with him.&mdash;Fisher
being the most athletick of the
two, handled him with so much ease,
that Comstock in a fit of passion <em>struck
him</em>. At this Fisher seized him, and
laid him upon deck several times in a
pretty rough manner.</p>

<p>Comstock then made some violent
threats, which Fisher paid no attention
to, but which now fell upon his soul
with all the horrors of reality. Finding
his cruel enemy deaf to his remonstrances,
and entreaties, he said, &ldquo;If there
is no hope, I will at least die like a man!&rdquo;
and having by order of Comstock, turned
back too, said in a firm voice, &ldquo;<em>I am
ready!!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comstock then put the muzzle of the
gun to his head, and fired, which instantly
put an end to his existence!&mdash;Mr.
Lumbert, during this time, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
begging for life, although no doubt mortally
wounded. Comstock, turned to him
and said, &ldquo;I am a bloody man! I have
a bloody hand and <em>will</em> be avenged!&rdquo;
and <em>again</em> run him through the body
with a bayonet! He then begged for
a little water; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you water,&rdquo;
said he, and once more plunging the
weapon in his body, left him for dead!</p>

<p>Thus it appears that this more than
demon, murdered with his own hand,
the whole! Gladly would we wash
from &ldquo;memory&rsquo;s waste&rdquo; all remembrance
of that bloody night. The compassionate
reader, however, whose
heart sickens within him, at the perusal,
as does ours at the recital, of this
tale of woe, will not, we hope, disapprove
our publishing these melancholy
facts to the world. As, through the
boundless mercy of Providence, we
have been restored, to the bosom of our
families and homes, we deemed it a duty
we owe to the world, to record our
&ldquo;unvarnished tale.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>Smith, the other boat-steerer, who
had been marked as one of the victims,
on hearing the noise in the cabin, went
aft, apprehending an altercation between
the Captain and some of the other officers,
little dreaming that innocent blood
was flowing in torrents. But what was
his astonishment, when he beheld Comstock,
brandishing the boarding knife,
and heard him exclaim, &ldquo;I am the bloody
man, and will have revenge!&rdquo; Horror
struck, he hurried forward, and asked
the crew in the forecastle, what he
should do. Some urged him to secrete
himself in the hold, others to go aloft
until Comstock&rsquo;s rage should be abated;
but alas! the reflection that the ship afforded
no secure hiding place, determined
him to confront the ringleader,
and if he could not save his life by fair
means, to sell it dearly! He was soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
called for by Comstock, who upon meeting
him, threw his bloody arms around
his neck, and embracing him, said, &ldquo;you
are going to be with us, are you not?&rdquo;
The reader will discover the good policy
of Smith when he unhesitatingly answered,
&ldquo;Oh, yes, I will do any thing
you require.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All hands were now called to make
sail, and a light at the same time was
set as a signal for the Lyra to tack;&mdash;while
the Globe was kept upon the
same tack, which very soon caused a
separation of the two ships. All the
reefs were turned out, top-gallant-sails
set, and all sail made on the ship, the
wind being quite light.</p>

<p>The mutineers then threw the body
of the Captain overboard, after wantonly
piercing his bowels with a boarding
knife, which was <em>driven with an axe</em>,
until the point protruded from his
throat!! In Mr. Beetle, the mate, the
lamp of life had not entirely gone out,
but he was committed to the deep.</p>

<p>Orders were next given to have the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
bodies of Mr. Fisher, and Mr. Lumbert
brought up. A rope was fastened to
Fisher&rsquo;s neck, by which he was hauled
upon deck. A rope was made fast to
Mr. Lumbert&rsquo;s feet, and in this way was
he got upon deck, but when in the act
of being thrown from the ship, he caught
the plank-shear; and appealed to Comstock,
reminding him of his promise to
save him, but in vain; for the monster
forced him from his hold, and he fell into
the sea! As he appeared to be yet
capable of swimming, a boat was ordered
to be lowered, to pursue and finish
him, fearing he might be picked up by
the Lyra; which order was as soon
countermanded as given, fearing, no
doubt, a desertion of his murderous
companions.</p>

<p>We will now present the reader, with
a journal of our passage to the Mulgrave
Islands, for which groupe we shaped
our course.</p>

<p>1824, Jan. 26th. At 2 A.&nbsp;M. from
being nearly calm a light breeze sprung
up, which increased to a fresh breeze
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
by 4 A.&nbsp;M. This day cleaned out the
cabin, which was a scene of blood and
destruction of which the recollection at
this day chills the blood in our veins.&mdash;Every
thing bearing marks of the murder,
was brought on deck and washed.</p>

<p>Lat. 5&deg;&nbsp;50' N. Long. 159&deg;&nbsp;13' W.</p>

<p>Jan. 27th. These twenty-four hours
commenced with moderate breezes from
the eastward. Middle and latter part
calm. Employed in cleaning the small
arms which were fifteen in number, and
making cartridge boxes.</p>

<p>Lat. 3&deg;&nbsp;45' N. Long. 160&deg;&nbsp;45' W.</p>

<p>Jan. 28. This day experienced fine
weather, and light breezes from N. by
W. The black steward was hung for
the following crime.</p>

<p>George Comstock who was appointed
steward after the mutiny, and business
calling him into the cabin, he saw
the former steward, now called the purser,
engaged in loading a pistol. He
asked him what he was doing that for.
His reply was, &ldquo;I have heard something
very strange, and I&rsquo;m going to be ready
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
for it.&rdquo; This information was immediately
carried to Comstock, who called
to Payne, now mate, and bid him follow
him.</p>

<p>On entering the cabin they saw Humphreys,
still standing with the pistol in
his hand. On being demanded what
he was going to do with it, he said he
had heard something which made him
afraid of his life!</p>

<p>Comstock told him if he had heard
any thing, that he ought to have come
to him, and let him know, before he
began loading pistols. He then demanded
to know, what he had heard.
Humphreys answered at first in a very
suspicious and ambiguous manner, but
at length said, that Gilbert Smith, the
boat-steerer who was saved, and Peter
Kidder, were going to re-take the ship.
This appeared highly improbable, but
they were summoned to attend a council
at which Comstock presided, and
asked if they had entertained any such
intentions. They positively denied ever
having had conversation upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
subject. All this took place in the evening.
The next morning the parties
were summoned, and a jury of two men
called. Humphreys under a guard of
six men, armed with muskets, was arraigned,
and Smith and Kidder, seated
upon a chest near him. The prisoner
was asked a few questions touching his
intentions, which he answered but low
and indistinctly. The trial, if it may
be so called, had progressed thus far,
when Comstock made a speech in the
following words. &ldquo;It appears that William
Humphreys <em>has been accused guilty</em>,
of a <em>treacherous and base act</em>, in loading
a pistol for the purpose of shooting Mr.
Payne and myself. Having been tried
the jury will now give in their verdict,
whether Guilty or Not Guilty. If guilty
he shall be hanged to a studding-sail
boom, rigged out eight feet upon the
fore-yard, but if found not guilty, Smith
and Kidder, shall be hung upon the
aforementioned gallows!&rdquo; But the doom
of Humphreys had been sealed the
night before, and kept secret <em>except from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the jury</em>, who returned a verdict of Guilty.&mdash;Preparations
were immediately
made for his execution! His watch was
taken from him, and he was then taken
forward and seated upon the rail, with
a cap drawn over his face, and the rope
placed round his neck.</p>

<p>Every man was ordered to take hold
of the execution rope, to be ready to
run him up when Comstock should give
the signal, by ringing the ship&rsquo;s bell!</p>

<p>He was now asked if he had any thing
to say, as he had but fourteen seconds
to live! He began by saying, &ldquo;little
did I think I was born to come to this&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;;&rdquo;
the bell struck! and he
was immediately swung to the yard-arm!
He died without a struggle; and after
he had hung a few minutes, the rope
was cut, to let him fall overboard, but
getting entangled aloft, the body was
towed some distance along side, when
a <i>runner hook</i>,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> was attached to it, to
sink it, when the rope was again cut and
the body disappeared. His chest was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
now overhauled, and sixteen dollars in
specie found, which he had taken from
the Captain&rsquo;s trunk. Thus ended the
life of one of the mutineers, while the
blood of innocent victims was scarcely
washed from his hands, much less the
guilty stain from his soul.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> A large hook used when hoisting in the blubber.</p>
</div>

<p>Feb. 7th. These twenty-four hours
commenced with thick squally weather.
Middle part clear and fine weather.&mdash;Hove
to at 2 A.&nbsp;M., and at 6 made
sail, and steered W. by S. At &frac12; past 8
made an Island ahead, one of the Kingsmill
groupe. Stood in with the land
and received a number of canoes along
side, the natives in them however having
nothing to sell us but a few beads
of their own manufacture. We saw
some cocoanut, and other trees upon
the shore, and discovered many of the
natives upon the beach, and some dogs.
The principal food of these Islanders is,
a kind of bread fruit, which they pound
very fine and mix it with fish.</p>

<p>Feb. 8. Commences squally with
fresh breezes from the northward.&mdash;Took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
a departure from Kingsmill Island;
one of the groupe of that name,
in Lat. 1&deg;&nbsp;27'&nbsp;N. and Long. 175&deg;&nbsp;14'&nbsp;E.
In the morning passed through the
channel between Marshall&rsquo;s and Gilbert&rsquo;s
Islands; luffed to and despatched
a boat to Marshall&rsquo;s Island, but did
not land, as the natives appeared hostile,
and those who swam off to the boat,
endeavoured to steal from her. When
about to leave, a volley of musketry was
discharged at them, which probably
killed or wounded some of them. The
boat then gave chase to a canoe, paddled
by two of the natives, which were
fired upon when within gunshot, when
they immediately ceased paddling; and
on the boat approaching them, discovered
that one of the natives was wounded.
In the most supplicating manner
they held up a jacket, manufactured
from a kind of flag, and some beads, being
all they possessed, giving their inhuman
pursuers to understand, that all
should be theirs if they would spare
their lives! The wounded native laid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
down in the bottom of the boat, and
from his convulsed frame and trembling
lip, no doubt remained but that the wound
was mortal. The boat then returned on
board and we made sail for the Mulgrave
Islands. Here was another sacrifice;
an innocent child of nature shot down,
merely to gratify the most wanton and
unprovoked cruelty, which could possibly
possess the heart of man. The unpolished
savage, a stranger to the more
tender sympathies of the human heart,
which are cultivated and enjoyed by
civilized nations, nurtures in his bosom
a flame of revenge, which only the blood
of those who have injured him, can
damp; and when years have rolled away,
this act of cruelty will be remembered
by these Islanders, and made
the pretext to slaughter every white
man who may fall into their hands.</p>

<p>Feb. 11th. Commenced with strong
breezes from the Northward. At &frac12;
past meridian made the land bearing
E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. four leagues distant. Stood
in and received a number of canoes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
along side. Sent a boat on shore; and
brought off a number of women, a large
quantity of cocoanuts, and some fish.&mdash;Stood
off shore most of the night, and</p>

<p>Feb. 12th, in the morning stood in
shore again and landed the women.&mdash;We
then stood along shore looking out
for an anchorage, and reconnoitering
the country, in the hope of finding some
spot suitable for cultivation; but in this
we were disappointed, or more properly
speaking, they, the mutineers; for
we had no will of our own, while our
bosoms were torn with the most conflicting
passions, in which Hope and
Despair alternately gained the ascendency.</p>

<p>Feb. 13th. After having stood off all
night, we in the morning stood in, and
after coasting the shores of several small
Islands, we came to one, low and narrow,
where it was determined the Ship
should be anchored. When nearly
ready to let go, a man was sent into the
chains to sound, who pronounced twelve
fathoms; but at the next cast, could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
not get bottom. We continued to stand
in, until we got regular sounding, and
anchored within five rods of the shore,
on a coral rock bottom, in seven fathoms
water. The ship was then moored with
a kedge astern, sails furled, and all
hands retired to rest, except an <i>anchor
watch</i>.</p>

<p>Feb. 14th, was spent in looking for
a landing place. In the morning a boat
was sent to the Eastward, but returned
with the information that no good landing
place could be found, the shore being
very rocky. At 2 P.&nbsp;M. she was
sent in an opposite direction, but returned
at night without having met with
better success; when it was determined
to land at the place where we lay;
notwithstanding it was very rocky.&mdash;Nothing
of consequence was done, until</p>

<p>Sunday, 15th Feb. 1824, when all
hands were set to work to construct a
raft out of the spare spars, upon which
to convey the provisions, &amp;c. on shore.</p>

<p>The laws by which we were now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
governed had been made by Comstock, soon
after the mutiny, and read as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That if any one saw a sail and did
not report it immediately, he should be
put to death! If any one refused to
fight a ship he should be put to death;
and the manner of their death, this&mdash;They
shall be bound hand and foot and
boiled in the <i>try pots</i>, of boiling oil!&rdquo;
Every man was made to seal and sign
this instrument, the seals of the mutineers
being <em>black</em>, and the remainder,
<em>blue</em> and <em>white</em>. The raft or stage being
completed, it was anchored, so that
one end rested upon the rocks, the other
being kept sea-ward by the anchor.
During the first day many articles were
brought from the ship in boats, to the
raft, and from thence conveyed on
shore. Another raft, however, was
made, by laying spars upon two boats,
and boards again upon them, which at
high water would float well up on the
shore. The following, as near as can
be recollected, were the articles landed
from the ship; (and the intention was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
when all should have been got on shore,
to haul the ship on shore, or as near it
as possible and burn her.) One mainsail,
one foresail, one mizen-topsail, one
spanker, one driver, one maintop gallantsail,
two lower studdingsails, two
royals, two topmast-studdingsails, two
top-gallant-studdingsails, one mizen-staysail,
two mizen-top-gallantsails, one
fly-gib, (thrown overboard, being a little
torn,) three boat&rsquo;s sails (new,) three
or four casks of bread, eight or ten
barrels of flour, forty barrels of beef
and pork, three or more 60 gal. casks
of molasses, one and a half barrels of
sugar, one barrel dried apples, one cask
vinegar, two casks of rum, one or two
barrels domestic coffee, one keg W.&nbsp;I.
coffee, one and a half chests of tea, one
barrel of pickles, one do. cranberries,
one box chocolate, one cask of tow-lines,
three or more coils of cordage,
one coil rattling, one do. lance warp,
ten or fifteen balls spunyarn, one do.
worming, one stream cable, one larboard
bower anchor, all the spare spars,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
every chest of clothing, most of the ship&rsquo;s
tools, &amp;c. &amp;c. The ship by this time
was considerably unrigged.</p>

<p>On the following day, Monday 16th
February, Payne the second in the mutiny,
who was on board the ship attending
to the discharge of articles from
her, sent word to Comstock, who with
Gilbert Smith and a number of the crew
were on shore, attending to the landing
of the raft; &ldquo;That if he did not act
differently with regard to the plunder,
such as making presents to the natives
of the officers&rsquo; fine clothing, &amp;c. he
would do no more, but quit the ship and
come on shore.&rdquo; Comstock had been
very liberal to the natives in this way,
and his object was, no doubt, to attach
them as much as possible to his person,
as it must have been suggested to his
guilty mind, that however he himself
might have become a misanthrope, yet
there were those around him, whose
souls shuddered at the idea of being
forever exiled from their country and
friends, whose hands were yet unstained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
by blood, but who might yet imbrue
them, for the purpose of escape from
lonely exile, and cruel tyranny.</p>

<p>When the foregoing message was received
from Payne, Comstock commanded
his presence immediately on shore,
and interrogated him, as to what he
meant by sending such a message. After
considerable altercation, which took
place in the tent, Comstock was heard
to say, &ldquo;I helped to take the ship, and
have navigated her to this place.&mdash;I have
also done all I could to get the sails and
rigging on shore, and now you may do
what you please with her; but if any
man wants any thing of <em>me</em>, I&rsquo;ll take a
musket with him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what I want,&rdquo; replied Payne,
&ldquo;and am ready!&rdquo; This was a check
upon the murderer, who had now the
offer of becoming a duellist; and he only
answered by saying, &ldquo;I will go on
board once more, and then you may do
as you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then went on board, and after destroying
the paper upon which were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
recorded the &ldquo;Laws,&rdquo; returned, went into
the tent with Payne, and putting a
sword into a scabbard, exclaimed, &ldquo;<em>this</em>
shall stand by me as long as I live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We ought not to omit to mention that
during the time he was on board the
ship, he challenged the persons there,
to fight him, and as he was leaving, exclaimed
&ldquo;I am going to leave you; <em>Look
out for yourselves!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>After obtaining from Payne permission
to carry with him a cutlass, a knife,
and some hooks and lines, he took his
departure, and as was afterwards ascertained,
immediately joined a gang of
natives, and endeavoured to excite them
to slay Payne and his companions! At
dusk of this day he passed the tent, accompanied
by about 50 of the natives,
in a direction of their village, upwards
of a league distant. Payne came on
board, and after expressing apprehensions
that Comstock would persuade
the natives to kill us all, picked out a
number of the crew to go on shore for
the night, and stationed sentinels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
around the tent, with orders to shoot any
one, who should attempt to approach
without giving the countersign. The
night, however, passed, without any
one&rsquo;s appearing; but early on the morning
of the</p>

<p>17th Feb.; Comstock was discovered
at some distance coming towards the
tent. It had been before proposed to
Smith by Payne, to shoot him; but
poor Smith like ourselves, dare do no
other than remain upon the side of neutrality.</p>

<p>Oliver, whom the reader will recollect
as one of the wretches concerned
in the mutiny, hurried on shore, and
with Payne and others, made preparations
to put him to death. After loading
a number of muskets they stationed
themselves in front of the tent, and waited
his approach&mdash;a bushy spot of ground
intervening, he did not make his appearance
until within a short distance
of the tent, which, as soon as he saw,
drew his sword and walked quick towards
it, in a menacing manner; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
as soon as he saw a number of the muskets
levelled at him, he waved his hand,
and cried out, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t shoot me, don&rsquo;t
shoot me! I will not hurt you!&rdquo; At
this moment they fired, and he fell!&mdash;Payne
fearing he might <em>pretend</em> to be
shot, ran to him with an axe, and nearly
severed his head from his body! There
were four muskets fired at him, but only
two balls took effect, one entered his
right breast, and passed out near the
back bone, the other through his head.</p>

<p>Thus ended the life, of perhaps as
cruel, blood-thirsty, and vindictive a being
as ever bore the form of humanity.</p>

<p>All hands were now called to attend
his burial, which was conducted in the
same inconsistent manner which had
marked the proceedings of the actors in
this tragedy. While some were engaged
in sewing the body in a piece of
canvas, others were employed in digging
a grave in the sand, adjacent to the
place of his decease, which, by order of
Payne, was made five feet deep. Every
article attached to him, including
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
his cutlass, was buried with him, except
his watch; and the ceremonies consisted
in <em>reading a chapter from the bible
over him, and firing a musket</em>!</p>

<p>Only twenty-two days had elapsed after
the perpetration of the massacre on
board the ship, when with all his sins
upon his head, he was hurried into eternity!</p>

<p>No duty was done during the remainder
of the day, except the selection by
Payne, of six men, to go on board the
ship and take charge of her, under the
command of Smith; who had communicated
his intentions to a number of running
away with the ship. We think we
cannot do better than to give an account
of their escape in the words of
Smith himself. It may be well to remark,
that Payne had ordered the two
binacle compasses to be brought on
shore, they being the only ones remaining
on board, except a hanging compass
suspended in the cabin. Secreting
one of the binacle compasses, he
took the hanging compass on shore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and the exchange was not discovered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At 7 P.&nbsp;M. we began to make preparations
for our escape with the ship.&mdash;I
went below to prepare some weapons
for our defence should we be attacked
by Payne, while the others, as silently
as possible, were employed in clearing
the running rigging, for every thing was
in the utmost confusion. Having found
one musket, three bayonets, and some
whale lances, they were laid handy, to
prevent the ship being boarded. A
handsaw well greased was laid upon
the windlass to saw off the cable, and the
only remaining hatchet on board, was
placed by the mizen mast, to cut the
stern moorings when the ship should
have sufficiently swung off. Taking
one man with me, we went upon the
fore-top-sail-yard, loosed the sail and
turned out the reefs, while two others
were loosing the main-top-sail and main
sail. I will not insult the reader&rsquo;s good
sense, by assuring him, that this was a
duty, upon the success of which seemed
to hang our very existence. By this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
time the moon was rising, which rendered
it dangerous to delay, for those
who had formed a resolution to swim
on board, and accompany us. The
<i>bunts</i> of the sails being yet confined aloft,
by their respective gaskets, I sent
a man on the fore-yard and another upon
the fore-top-sail-yard, with orders to
<i>let fall</i>, when I should give the word;
one man being at the helm, and two
others at the fore tack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was now half past nine o&rsquo;clock,
when I took the handsaw, and in less
than two minutes the cable was off!&mdash;The
ship <i>payed off</i> very quick, and when
her head was off the land, there being
a breeze from that quarter, the hawser
was cut and all the sail we could make
upon the ship immediately set, a fine
fair wind blowing. A raft of iron hoops,
which was towing along side, was cut
adrift, and we congratulated each other
upon our fortunate escape; for even
with a vast extent of ocean to traverse,
hope excited in our bosoms a belief that
we should again embrace our friends,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and our joy was heightened by the reflection,
that we might be the means of
rescuing the innocents left behind, and
having the guilty punished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a long and boisterous passage
the ship arrived at Valparaiso, when
she was taken possession of by the American
Consul, Michael Hogan, Esq.
and the persons on board were put in
irons on board a French frigate, there
being no American man-of-war in port.
Their names were, Gilbert Smith,
George Comstock, Stephen Kidder,
Joseph Thomas, Peter C. Kidder, and
Anthony Henson.</p>

<p>Subsequently they were all examined
before the U.&nbsp;S. Consul; and with the
following, an examination of Gilbert
Smith, we shall commence another
chapter.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>U.&nbsp;S. Consulate,<br />
<span class="padleft">Valparaiso, 15th June, 1824.</span></p>

<p>Gilbert Smith examined on oath,
touching the mutiny and murder on board
the whale ship Globe, of Nantucket,
Massachusetts, in the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i> Who were the Captain
and mates of the ship Globe?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> Thomas Worth, Captain; William
Beetle, first mate; John Lumbert,
second mate; Nathaniel Fisher, third
mate.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Where was you born?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> In the town of Edgarton, State
of Massachusetts.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did you sail from thence in the
ship Globe of Nantucket, 20th Dec.
1822, and in what capacity?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes; as a boat-steerer.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Was there any thing like mutiny
on board the ship during her passage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
to the Sandwich Islands?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How many men belonged to the
ship on sailing from Nantucket?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Twenty-one in all.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did any run away at the Sandwich
Islands?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Six men ran away, and one was
discharged.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How many men were shipped
in their places?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> John Oliver, of Shields, England;
Silas Payne, of Rhode Island;
Thomas Lilliston, of Virginia; William
Steward, of Philadelphia, (black;) Anthony
Henson, of Barnstable; and a native
of the Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> On what day or night did this
murderous mutiny take place?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> On Sunday night the 26th of
January, this year; in the morning of
that day there was a great disturbance,
in consequence of Joseph Thomas having
insulted the Captain, for which he
was whipped by the Captain, with the
end of the main buntline. The part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the crew not <i>stationed</i> stood in the hatchway
during the punishment.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did any thing happen in consequence,
during that day?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No: I lived aft; I heard nothing
about it; Capt. Joy of the Lyra,
was on board nearly all day.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How were you stationed during
the night?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The Captain, first and second
mates, kept no watch during that night;
the rest of the crew were stationed in
three watches, in charge of the third
mate and boat-steerers.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Who had charge of the first watch
during that night?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I had charge of the watch from
7 to 10 o&rsquo;clock. At 8 the Captain came
on deck, and had two reefs taken in the
topsails, and at 9 went down, leaving
me the orders for the night, to keep
the ship <i>by the wind</i>, until two o&rsquo;clock,
and not to tack until the other watch
came up; and on tacking, a light to be
set for the Lyra who was in company,
to tack also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
At 10 o&rsquo;clock I went below, being
relieved by the boat-steerer Comstock,
to whom I passed the orders given me
by the Captain,&mdash;&mdash;(Here follows a detailed
account of the mutiny, with which
the reader has already been made acquainted.)</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Do you believe that Joseph
Thomas had any knowledge of Comstock&rsquo;s
intent to commit murder that
night?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I think he must have known
something about it, according to his talk.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Do you believe that any other
person in the ship, besides those persons
who committed the murder, knew
of the intention?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Thomas Lilliston knew about it,
because he went to the cabin door with
an axe, and a <i>boat knife</i> in his hand, in
company with the murderers, but he
did not go below.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did you live with them aft, afterwards?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No: I lived in the forecastle, but
all on board eat in the cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
<i>Q.</i> Name all the persons you left on
the Island, where you cut the cable of
the ship and escaped.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Silas Payne, John Oliver, (being
the principal mutineers next to Samuel
B. Comstock,) Thomas Lilliston, Rowland
Coffin, <i>William Lay</i>, <i>Cyrus M.
Hussey</i>, Columbus Worth, Rowland
Jones, and the Sandwich Island native,
called Joseph Brown. The last five I
believe ignorant of any knowledge of
the intent to murder.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What became of Samuel B. Comstock,
who was the head mutineer after
he landed upon the Island?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> He was shot on the morning of
the 17th Feb. by Silas Payne, and John
Oliver, his associates in all the mutiny
and murderous course they had pursued,
and buried five feet deep on the
beach near their tent; a chapter was
read from the bible by me, acting under
the orders of Payne, and muskets
were fired by his orders, by the men.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Why did they murder Comstock?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
<i>A.</i> For giving away to the natives
clothes and other articles before they
were divided.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Were the natives friendly and
quiet?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes; very peaceable, gave away
any thing they had; bread fruit,
cocoanuts and other things.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How did Joseph Thomas conduct
himself during the passage from
the Isle to this port?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> In common, when help was called,
he was the first man disobedient,
and frequently said he would do as he
pleased.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did he often speak of the murder,
or of his knowing it about to take
place?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I only remember, having heard
him twice. I told him when we arrived,
I would inform the American Consul
of it; to which he replied, he should
own all he knew about it.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> To what State does he belong
to your knowledge?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
<i>A.</i> To the State of Connecticut, he
says.</p>

<p class="sig">(Signed) GILBERT SMITH.<br />
Sworn to, before me at Valparaiso,<br />
this eighteenth day of June, 1824.</p>

<p class="sig">(Signed) MICHAEL HOGAN,<br />
U.&nbsp;S. Consul.</p>

<p>The examination of the others who
came in the ship, was but a repetition
of the foregoing. All, however, concurred
in believing, that Joseph Thomas
was privy to the intention to mutiny,
and murder the officers.</p>

<p>The ship was then furnished with necessary
sails and rigging, and placed in
charge of a Captain King, who brought
her to the Island of Nantucket, arriving
on Sunday 21st November, 1824. Another
examination was held before Josiah
Hussey, Esq. and all testified, as before
the American Consul at Valparaiso.</p>

<p>Thomas, who was put in irons as soon
as the land was discovered, was arraigned
before the above named justice, and
after an elaborate hearing, the prisoner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
was committed to jail, to take his trial at
the following term of the U.&nbsp;S. District
Court, and the witnesses recognised in
the sum of three hundred dollars each.</p>

<p>Leaving Thomas, awaiting his trial,
and the others in the enjoyment of the
society of their families and friends, we
will return to the Mulgrave Islands, the
scene of no inconsiderable portion of
our distresses and adventures.</p>

<p>On the 17th Feb. when night came,
the watch was set consisting of two men,
whose duty it was to guard against the
thefts of the natives. At about 10 P.&nbsp;M.
all hands were awakened by the
cry; &ldquo;The ship has gone, the ship has
gone!&rdquo; Every one hastened to the
beach and verified the truth of the report
for themselves. Some who were
ignorant of the intention of Smith and
others, to take the ship, were of opinion
that the strong breeze then blowing, had
caused her to drag her anchor, and that
she would return in the morning.</p>

<p>The morning came, but nothing was
to be seen upon the broad expanse of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
ocean, save here and there a solitary
seagull, perched upon the crested billow.
Payne in a paroxism of rage, vented
the most dreadful imprecations;
swearing that could he get them once
more in his power, he would put them
to instant death. Not so with us; a ray
of hope shot through our minds, that
this circumstance might be the means of
rescuing us from our lonely situation.&mdash;The
writers of this narrative were upon
the most intimate terms, and frequently,
though carefully, sympathized with each
other upon their forlorn situation. We
dare not communicate our disaffection
to the Government of the two surviving
mutineers, (Payne and Oliver,) to the
others, fearing they might not agree
with us in opinion, and we had too good
reason to believe, that there was <em>one</em>,
who although unstained by blood, yet
from his conduct, seemed to sanction
the proceedings of the mutineers.</p>

<p>The natives assembled in great numbers
around the tent, expressing great
surprise at the ship&rsquo;s having left,&mdash;Payne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
gave them to understand that
the wind had forced her to sea, and that
from her want of sails, rigging, &amp;c. she
must be lost, and would never return.&mdash;The
natives received the assurance
with satisfaction, but it was evident,
Payne apprehended her safe arrival at
some port, and his own punishment;
for we were immediately set to work, to
tear one boat to pieces, for the purpose
of raising upon another, which was to
have <em>a deck</em>; Payne, alleging as a reason
for this, that the natives might compel
us to leave the Island. We leave
the reader to judge, however, of his motives,
while we proceed to give an account
of what actually did transpire.</p>

<p>The natives in considerable numbers
continued to attend us, and while the
work was progressing, exhibited a great
deal of curiosity. Their deportment
towards us continued to be of the most
friendly nature, continuing to barter
with us, giving us bread fruit, cocoanuts,
&amp;c. for which they received in return,
pieces of iron hoop, nails, and such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
articles as we could conveniently spare.</p>

<p>The small Islands of this groupe are
frequently only separated by what are
sometimes denominated causeways, or
in other words, connected by reefs of
coral, extending from the extreme point
of one Island and connecting it with another.
These reefs are nearly dry at
low water, and the communication is
easily kept up between them by the natives
on foot.</p>

<p>On the 19th, in the morning, having
obtained permission, several of us left
the tent, travelling to the Eastward.&mdash;After
crossing upon the causeways to
several adjacent islands, we discovered
numerous tracks of the natives in the
sand, and having followed them about
seven miles, came to a village consisting
of about twenty or thirty families; and
were received by them with great hospitality.
They presented us with bread
fruit and the milk of cocoanuts, while
the wonder and astonishment of those
who had not as yet seen us, particularly
the women and children, were expressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
by the most uncouth grimaces, attended
with boisterous laughter, and capering
around us. What more particularly
excited their astonishment was the whiteness
of our skins, and their mirth knew no
bounds when they heard us converse.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 20th,
we were ordered to go to work upon
the boat; but at the request of a number,
this duty was dispensed with, and
we permitted to stroll about the Island.
A number went to the village, carrying
with them muskets, at the report of
which and the effect produced by the
balls, the natives were struck with wonder
and astonishment. The reader will no
doubt agree with us when we pronounce
this to have been a bad policy, for they
certainly disliked to have visitors possessed
of such formidable and destructive
weapons. They however continued
to visit the tent without discovering
any hostile intentions, and we continued
to put the utmost confidence in them,
or more properly speaking to live without
any fear of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
I (William Lay,) left the tent on a
visit to the village, where I was received
with the same kindness as before.&mdash;An
old man between 50 and 60 years of
age, pressed me to go to his house and
tarry during the night, which I did.&mdash;The
natives continued in and around
the tent until a late hour, gratifying their
curiosity by a sight of me. I was provided
with some mats to sleep upon, but
the rats, with which the Island abounds,
prevented my enjoying much sleep.</p>

<p>At 10 o&rsquo;clock I took my leave of
them, with the exception of a number,
who accompanied me to the tent.</p>

<p>Silas Payne and John Oliver, together
with two or three others, set out in
one of the boats, for the purpose of exploring
the Island, and making new discoveries,
leaving the rest of us to guard
the tent. They were absent but one
night, when they returned, bringing with
them two young women, whom Payne
and Oliver took as their wives. The women
apparently showing no dissatisfaction,
but on the contrary appeared much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
diverted. Payne now put such confidence
in the natives, that he dispensed
with having a watch kept during the
night, and slept as secure as though he
had been in his native country.</p>

<p>Payne, on awaking near morning, found
the woman that he had brought to live
with him was missing. After searching
the tent, and finding nothing of her, concluded
she had fled. He accordingly
armed himself, together with John Oliver
and Thomas Lilliston, (with muskets,)
and set out for the nearest village,
for the purpose of searching her
out. They arrived at the village before
it was light, and secreted themselves
near an Indian hut, where they awaited
the approach of day, in hopes of seeing
her. Accordingly at the approach of
day-light, they discovered the hut literally
thronged with natives, and among
the number, they discovered the woman
they were in search of. At this moment
one of them fired a blank cartridge
over their heads, and then presented
themselves to their view, which frightened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the natives in such a manner that
they left the hut and fled. Payne then
pursued after, firing over their heads
till he caught the one he wanted, and
then left the village for his own tent.&mdash;On
arriving at the tent, he took her,
gave her a severe flogging and then
put her in irons, and carried on in this
kind of style until he was by them killed,
and called to render up his accounts
to his offended Judge.</p>

<p>This severity on the part of Payne,
irritated the natives, and was undoubtedly
the cause of their committing depredations
and theft, and finally murdering
all our remaining crew, excepting
myself and Hussey.</p>

<p>Early on the succeeding morning, it
was discovered that the tool chest had
been broken open, and a hatchet, chisel,
and some other articles, purloined by
the natives. Payne worked himself into
a passion, and said he would be revenged.
During the day he informed
a number of the natives of what had
been done, (who signified much regret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
at the circumstance,) and vowing vengeance
if the articles were not returned.
During this day the natives frequented
the tent more than they had
ever done before; and at night one of
them came running with <em>one half</em> of the
chisel which had been stolen, it having
been broken in two.</p>

<p>Payne told them it was but half of
what he required, and put the Indian in
irons, signifying to him, that in the morning
he must go with him to the village,
and produce the rest of the articles, and
also point out the persons engaged in
breaking open the chest. The poor native
seemed much chagrined at his confinement;
yet his companions who remained
near the tent during the night,
manifested no dissatisfaction, which we
could observe.</p>

<p>In the morning, Payne selected four
men, viz: Rowland Coffin, Rowland
Jones, Cyrus M. Hussey, and Thomas
Lilliston, giving them each a musket,
some powder and <i>fine shot</i>; declining
to give them balls, saying, the report of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the muskets would be sufficient to intimidate
them. The prisoner was placed
in charge of these men, who had orders
to go to the village, and recover
the hatchet and bring back the person
whom the prisoner might point out as
the thief.</p>

<p>They succeeded in getting the hatchet,
but when about to return, the natives
in a great body, attacked them
with stones. Finding that they retreated,
the natives pursued them, and having
overtaken Rowland Jones, killed
him upon the spot. The remainder, although
bruised with the stones which
these Islanders had thrown with great
precision, arrived at the tent with the
alarming intelligence of a difficulty;&mdash;while
they followed in the rear armed
for war!</p>

<p>No time was lost in arming ourselves,
while the natives collected from all
quarters, and at a short distance from
the tent, seemed to hold a kind of council.
After deliberating some time, they
began to tear to pieces one of the boats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
These were of vital importance to
our guilty commander, and he ventured
to go to them for the purpose of pacifying
them. One of the Chiefs sat down
upon the ground with him, and after they
had set a few moments, Payne accompanied
the Chief into the midst of the
natives. After a conference with them
which lasted nearly an hour, he returned
to the tent, saying that he had pacified
the natives upon the following conditions.
They were to have every article
belonging to us, even to the tent;
and Payne had assured them of his willingness,
and that of the others to live
with, and be governed by them, and to
adopt their mode of living! We have
reason to doubt the sincerity of Payne
in this respect, for what was to us a hope
which we cherished with peculiar pleasure,
must have been to him, a source
of fearful anticipation&mdash;we mean the
probable safe arrival of the ship, in the
U.&nbsp;S. which should result in our deliverance.
Our situation at this time was
truly alarming; and may we not with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
propriety say, distressing? Surrounded
by a horde of savages, brandishing
their war clubs and javelins, our more
than savage commanders, (Payne and
Oliver) in anxious suspense as to the
result of their negociations with them;
no refuge from <em>either foe</em>, and what contributed
not a little to our unhappiness,
was a consciousness of being innocent
of having in the least manner wilfully
aided the destroyers of the lives of
our officers, and the authors of our now,
truly unhappy situation.</p>

<p>The natives now began to help themselves
to whatever articles suited them,
and when some of them began to pull
the tent down, an old man and his wife
took hold of me, and after conducting
me a few rods from the tent, sat down,
keeping fast hold of my hands. Under
the most fearful apprehensions I endeavoured
to get from them, but they
insisted upon detaining me. I endeavoured
to console myself with the idea,
that gratitude had prompted them to
take care of me, as I had frequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
taken the part of this old woman, when
she had been teased by others; but
alas! the reflection followed, that if this
was the case, there was a probability
that not only my bosom friend, was about
to be sacrificed, but I should be
left alone to drag out a weary existence,
with beings, strangers to the endearing
ties which bind the hearts of civilized
man.</p>

<p>Whether Payne and his associates offered
any resistance to the course now
pursued by the natives or not, I do not
know. Suffice it to say, that all at once
my ears were astounded with the most
terrifying whoops and yells; when a
massacre commenced but little exceeded
by the one perpetrated on board the
Globe. Our men fled in all directions,
but met a foe at every turn. Lilliston
and Joe Brown (the Sandwich Islander,)
fell within six feet of me, and as
soon as down, the natives macerated
their heads with large stones. The first
whom I saw killed, was Columbus
Worth. An old woman, apparently sixty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
years of age, ran him through with a
spear, and finished him with stones!</p>

<p>My protectors, for now they were
truly so, shut out the scene by laying
down upon the top of me, to hide me
from the view of the merciless foe! I
was however discovered, and one of
the natives attempted to get a blow at
me with a handspike, which was prevented
by them; when, after a few words,
he hurried away.</p>

<p>As soon as the work of death had been
completed, the old man took me by the
hand and hurried me along towards the
village. My feet were very much laccerated
in passing over the <i>causeways</i>
of sharp coral rock, but my conductor
fearing we might be pursued, hurried
me onward to the village, where we arrived
about noon. In a few minutes the
wigwam or hut of the old man, was surrounded,
and all seeming to talk at once,
and with great excitement, I anticipated
death every moment. Believing myself
the sole survivor, the reader must pardon
any attempt to describe my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
feelings, when I saw a number of the natives
approaching the hut, and in the
midst, Cyrus M. Hussey, conducted
with great apparent kindness.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding we had both been
preserved much after the same manner,
we could not divest ourselves of the apprehension,
that we perhaps had been
preserved, for a short time, to suffer
some lingering death.</p>

<p>Our interview was only long enough
to satisfy each other that we alone survived
the massacre, when we were separated;
Hussey being taken away, and
it seemed quite uncertain, even if our
lives were spared, whether we ever saw
each other again.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>On the following day, however, accompanied
by natives, we met at the
scene of destruction, and truly it was
an appalling one to us. The mangled
corpses of our companions, rendered
more ghastly from the numerous wounds
they had received, the provisions, clothing,
&amp;c. scattered about the ground,
the hideous yells of exultation uttered
by the natives, all conspired to render
our situation superlatively miserable.</p>

<p>We asked, and obtained leave from
our masters, to bury the bodies which
lay scattered about. We dug some
graves in the sand, and after finishing
this melancholy duty, were directed to
launch the canoes, preparatory to our
departure, (for we had come in canoes)
when we begged permission, which was
readily granted, to take some flour,
bread and pork, and our respective
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
masters assisted us in getting a small quantity
of these articles into the largest canoe.
We also took a blanket each, some
shoes, a number of books, including a
bible, and soon arrived at the landing
place near the village. As the natives
seemed desirous of keeping us apart,
we dare not make any inquiries for
each other, but at my request, having
boiled some pork in a large shell,
Hussey was sent for, and we had a meal
together; during which time, the natives
assembled in great numbers, all
anxious to get a sight, not only of our
<em>novel mode of cutting the meat and eating
it</em>, but of the manner in which we prepared
it. One of them brought us some
water in a tin cup, as they had seen us
drink frequently when eating.</p>

<p>The natives now began to arrive from
distant parts of the islands, many of
whom had not yet heard of us, and we
were continually subjected to the examination
of men, women and children.
The <em>singular colour</em> of our skin, was
the greatest source of their admiration,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and we were frequently importuned to
adopt their dress.</p>

<p>On the 28th Feb. early in the morning
the whole village appeared to be in
motion. All the adults commenced <em>ornamenting</em>
themselves, which to me appeared
to render them <em>hideous</em>. After
greasing themselves with cocoanut oil,
and hanging about them numerous
strings of beads, they set off, taking us
with them, to a flat piece of ground, about
half a mile distant, where we found
collected a great number, and all ornamented
in the same fantastic manner.&mdash;Knowing
that many of the natives inhabiting
Islands in the Pacific Ocean,
are cannibals, we were not without
our fears that we had been preserved
to grace a feast! Our apprehensions,
however, were dissipated, when we saw
them commence a dance, of which we
will endeavour to give the reader some
idea. The only musical instrument we
saw, was a rude kind of drum; and the
choristers were all females, say twenty
or thirty, each having one of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
drums. The music commenced with
the women, who began upon a very
low key, gradually raising the notes,
while the natives accompanied them
with the most uncouth gesticulations
and grimaces. The precision with
which about three hundred of these
people, all dancing at a time, regulated
their movements, was truly astonishing;
while the yelling of the whole body,
each trying to exceed the other, rendered
the scene to us, not only novel,
but terrifick.</p>

<p>The dance ended near night, and
those natives who lived in a distant part
of the Island, after gratifying their curiosity
by gazing upon us, and even
<em>feeling of our skins</em>, took their departure.</p>

<p>After our return to the village, we
cooked some meat upon the coals, and
with some bread, made a hearty meal.
One source of regret to us, was, that the
natives began to like our bread, which
heretofore they had scarcely dared to
taste; and particularly the woman whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
I called mistress, ate, to use a sea
phrase, her <em>full allowance</em>.</p>

<p>The natives expressed great dislike
at our conversing together, and prohibited
our reading, as much as possible.
We never could make them comprehend
that the book conveyed ideas to us, expressed
in our own language.</p>

<p>Whether from a fear that we might
concert some plan of escape, or that we
might be the means of doing them some
injury while together, we know not;&mdash;but
about the first of April, we discovered
that we were about to be separated!
The reader may form some idea
of our feelings when we were informed
that Hussey was to be taken by his
master and family, to a distant part of
the Island! Not having as yet become
sufficiently acquainted with their language,
we were unable to comprehend
the distance from our present location.</p>

<p>It now becomes expedient to present
the reader with our <em>separate accounts</em>, in
which we hope to be able to convey an
idea of the manners and customs of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
these people. We had experienced in
a very short time so many vicissitudes,
and passed through so many scenes of
distress, that no opportunity was afforded
to keep a journal, and notwithstanding
we had even lost the day of the
week and month, yet with such force,
were the principal incidents which occurred
during our exile, impressed upon
our minds, that we can with confidence
proceed with our narrative, and
will commence the next chapter with
an account of the adventures of <i>William
Lay</i>.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>Early in the morning of the day on
which Hussey left me, preparations
were made for his embarkation with his
<em>new</em> master and family. We were allowed
a short interview, and after taking
an affectionate leave of each other, we
parted with heavy hearts. The tender
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
ties which bound me to my companion
in misfortune, seemed now about to be
forever broken asunder. No features
to gaze upon, but those of my savage
masters, and no one with whom I could
hold converse, my heart seemed bursting
with grief at my lonely situation.&mdash;On
the departure of my companion, the
&ldquo;star of hope&rdquo; which had often gleamed
brightly mid the night of our miseries,
seemed now about to set forever!
After watching the canoe which bore
him from me, until she was hid from my
view in the distance, I returned to the
hut with my master, and as I had eaten
but little during the day, the calls of nature
induced me to broil my last morsel
of meat, with which, and some bread, I
made a tolerable supper. The natives
began to be very fond of the bread, and
eat of it as long as it lasted, which unfortunately
for me, was but a short time.</p>

<p>I informed my master that I should
like to have some more of the meat from
the place where the ship had lain. On
the following morning, my master,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
mistress, and four or five others embarked
in a canoe, to assist me in procuring
some provisions. Observing that they
carried with them a number of clubs,
and each a spear, I was apprehensive
of some design upon my own person;
but happily, was soon relieved, by seeing
them wade round a shoal of fish, and
after having frightened them into shoal
water, kill a number with their spears.
We then proceeded on, and when we
arrived at the <i>tent</i>, they cooked them
after the following manner. A large
fire was kindled, and after the wood
was burned to coals, the fish were
thrown on, and snatched and eaten as
fast as cooked; although they were
kind enough to preserve a share for me,
yet the scene around me, prevented my
enjoying with them, their meal. The
tent which had been torn down, had
contained about forty barrels of beef
and pork, two hogsheads of molasses,
barrels of pickles, all the clothing and
stores belonging to the ship, in short,
every thing valuable, such as charts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
nautical instruments, &amp;c. &amp;c. The latter
had been broken and destroyed, to
make ornaments, while the beef, pork,
molasses and small stores lay scattered
promiscuously around. They appeared
to set no value upon the clothing, except
to tear and destroy it. The pieces
of beef and pork, from the barrels,
(which had been all stove,) were scattered
in every direction, and putrifying
in the sun. After putting into the canoe
some pork and a few articles of
clothing, we commenced our return;&mdash;but
a strong head wind blowing, we had
considerable difficulty in getting back.</p>

<p>For some considerable time, nothing
material occurred, and I led as monotonous
and lonely a life, as could well be
imagined. It is true, I was surrounded
by fellow beings; and had all hope
of ever seeing my country and friends
again, been blasted, it is probable I
might have become <em>more</em> reconciled to
my condition, but I very much doubt if
ever perfectly so, as long as reason and
reflection held their empire over my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
mind. My books having been destroyed
from a superstitious notion of their
possessing some supernatural power, I
was left to brood over my situation unpitied
and alone.</p>

<p>Sometime in July, as I judged, <i>Luckiair</i>,
son-in-law to my master, <i>Ludjuan</i>,
came from a distant part of the groupe,
on a visit, and during the week he remained
with us, we became much attached
to each other. When he told
me, that on his return he should pass
near the place where Hussey lived, my
anxiety to accompany him thus far, was
so great, that after much persuasion,
<i>Ludjuan</i> gave his consent for me to go.
On our way we stopped at the tent, and
I procured for the last time, a small
quantity of the <i>ship&rsquo;s provisions</i>, although
the meat was some of it in a very decayed
state.</p>

<p>In consequence of head winds, we
were compelled to stop for the night
upon a small Island, where we found
an uninhabited hut; and after cooking
some meat, and baking some wet flour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
(for it was no other) in the ashes, we
took our mats into the hut, and remained
until next day. The wind continuing
to blow fresh ahead, we gathered
some green bread fruit, and cooked
some meat, in the same manner as they
cook the largest of their fish, which is
this.&mdash;A hole is dug in the ground, and
after it has been filled with wood, it is
set on fire, and then covered with stones.
As the wood burns away, the heated
stones fall to the bottom, which, when
the fire is out, are covered with a thick
layer of green leaves, and then the meat
or fish is placed upon these leaves, and
covered again in a careful and ingenious
manner, and the whole covered with
earth. This preserves the juices of the
fish, and in this way do they cook most
of their fish, with <em>hot stones</em>.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the weather proving
more favourable, we left our encampment,
and at sun down arrived at a
place called Tuckawoa; at which place
we were treated with the greatest hospitality.
When we were about to leave,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
we were presented with bread fruit and
cocoanuts in great abundance. As we
approached the place of Hussey&rsquo;s residence,
I discovered him standing on
the beach. Our joy at meeting, I will
not attempt to describe.&mdash;We had a
short time, however, allowed us, in
which to relate our adventures, and condole
with each other; for in <em>an hour</em> we
were once more separated; and we
pursued our course for the residence
of Luck-i-a-ir. After encamping another
night upon the beach, we at length
arrived at the house of my conductor,
which was at a place called <i>Dillybun</i>.
His family consisted of his wife and one
child, whom we found busily engaged
in making a fishing net. When near
night <i>Luckiair</i> and myself went out and
gathered some breadfruit, and after making
a hearty meal, slept soundly upon
our mats until morning.</p>

<p>A little before noon on the following
day, two natives with their wives, arrived
from Luj-no-ne-wort, the place
where Hussey lived, and brought me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
some flour, and a piece of meat. The
natives would eat of the bread, but
would not taste of the meat. I remained
here about a week, when <i>Ludjuan</i>
came for me. Nothing occurred of
note, during our passage back to <i>Milly</i>,
(the place of my residence,) where I
was welcomed by the natives with every
demonstration of joy. I was sent
for by one of the chiefs, who asked many
questions, and as a mark of his friendship
for me, when I was about to return,
presented me with a kind of food
called <i>cha-kak-a</i>. My present consisted
of a piece about two feet long and
six inches in diameter. It is made of a
kind of fruit common among these Islands,
and called by the inhabitants,
<i>bup</i>. The fruit is scraped very fine, and
then laid in the sun until perfectly dry.
Some of the leaves of the tree bearing
the fruit, are then wrapped round a
piece of wood, which is the <i>mould or
former</i>, and when securely tied with
strings, the former is withdrawn, and
into this cylinder of leaves is put the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
<i>bup</i>, which is of a sweet and pleasant
taste.</p>

<p>At the urgent request of the natives,
I now adopted their dress. Having but
one pair of trowsers and a shirt left, I
laid them by for bad weather, and put
on the costume of a Mulgrave Islander.
This dress, if it may be so called, consists
in a broad belt fastened round the
waist, from which is suspended two
broad tassels. The belt is made from
the leaves of the <i>bup tree</i>, and very ingeniously
braided, to which is attached
the tassels, which are made of a coarser
material, being the bark of a small
vine, in their language called <i>aht-aht</i>.
When the dress is worn, one of the
tassels hangs before and the other behind.
The sun, as I expected, burned
my skin very much; which the natives
could not account for, as nothing of the
kind ever happened among themselves.</p>

<p>One day there was seen approaching
a number of canoes, which we found
were loaded with fish for the chiefs, and
to my great joy, Hussey was one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
passengers. My master accompanied
me to see him; and we anticipated at
least a mental feast in each other&rsquo;s society.
But of this enjoyment we were
deprived by the natives, who were always
uneasy when we were conversing
together.</p>

<p>I learned, however, from Hussey,
that the natives had been kind to him;
but before we had an opportunity to
communicate to each other our hopes
and fears, he was hurried away. Having
now gained considerable knowledge
of their language, I learned that they
were afraid that if we were permitted
to hold converse, we should be the
means of provoking the <em>Supreme God</em>,
<i>Anit</i>, to do them some injury.</p>

<p>The bread fruit beginning to ripen,
we were all employed in gathering it;
and I will endeavour to give the reader
an idea of the process of preserving it.
After the fruit was gathered, the outside
rind was scraped off, and the seeds taken
out; which are in size and appearance
like a chesnut. The fruit is then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
put into a net, the meshes of which are
quite small, taken into the salt water,
and then beat with a club to pummice.
It is then put into baskets made of cocoanut
leaves, and in about two days
becomes like a rotten apple; after
which the <em>cores</em> are taken out, and the
remainder after undergoing a process
of kneading, is put into a hole in the
ground, the bottom and sides of which
are neatly inlaid with leaves, and left about
two days; when it again undergoes
the same process of kneading, and so
on, until it becomes perfectly dry.&mdash;This
occupied us a number of days;
and when we were engaged in gathering
another, and a larger kind, a small
boy came running towards us, and exclaimed,
&ldquo;<i>Uroit a-ro rayta mony la
Wirrum</i>,&rdquo; that is, the chiefs are going
to kill William. Ludjuan seeing that I
understood what the boy said, he said
&ldquo;reab-reab!&rdquo; it is false. From the pains
taken by the natives to keep Hussey
and myself apart, it was evident that
they were in some measure afraid of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
us; but from what cause I had yet to
learn. After passing a sleepless night,
we again in the morning pursued our labors,
but I was continually agitated by
fearful apprehensions. About midnight
I overheard some of the natives in the
tent talking about me, and I was now
convinced that some injury was contemplated.
I then asked them what I was
to be killed for. They seemed surprised
when I told them I had been listening;
yet they denied that I was to be
killed, and one of them who had frequently
manifested for me much friendship,
came to my mat, and lay down with
me, assuring me I should not be injured.</p>

<p>The harvest being ended, a feast was
had, and the chiefs were presented with
considerable quantities of this fruit, after
it had been prepared and baked,
which in taste resembled a sweet potatoe,
sending presents of it in all directions
about the Island.</p>

<p>Having now but little work to do, I
confined myself to the hut as much as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
possible, for I had been observed for
some time in a very suspicious manner.
In a few days I was informed that Hussey
had been brought to the Island, and
it was immediately suggested to my
anxious mind, that we were now to be
sacrificed. Ludjuan went with me to
see Hussey, but we were only allowed
a few moments conversation, when I
was taken back to the hut, and communicated
my fears to my old mistress, who
sympathized with me, but said if the
chiefs had determined it, there was no
hope for me. I now was made acquainted
with the cause of their dislike, which
was no less than a superstitious idea,
that we were the cause of a malady,
then raging to considerable extent!</p>

<p>This disease consisted in the swelling
of the hands and feet, and in many
instances the faces of the youth swelled
to such a degree, that they were blind
for a number of days. Such a disease
they had never before been afflicted
with. I had now an opportunity of most
solemnly protesting my total inability
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to injure them in this way, and as the
disease had as yet caused no death, I
had a hope of being spared. I learned
that a majority of the chiefs in council,
were for putting me to death, but one
of them in particular, protested against
it, fearing it might be the cause of some
worse calamity. As the vote to carry
into effect any great measure, must be
unanimous, this chief was the means by
his dissenting, of saving my life.</p>

<p>The afflicted began to recover, and
my fears were greatly lessened; but as
these people are of a very unstable and
changeful character, I could not entirely
divest myself of apprehensions.</p>

<p>As soon as the harvest was completed,
great preparations were made for
the embarkation of the chiefs, who
were going to make their annual visit
to the different Islands. They told me
that the King, whom they called La-boo-woole-yet,
lived on an Island at
the N.&nbsp;W. and if he did not receive his
yearly present of preserved bread fruit
and <i>pero</i>, he would come with a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
party to fight them. Twelve canoes
were put in the water, each one carrying
a part of the provisions, and manned
by about two hundred persons.</p>

<p>After an absence of four or five days,
during which time we exchanged civilities
with numerous chiefs, we returned
to <i>Milly</i>, and hauled up the canoes. I
now learned that the principal chief, had
said that it would have been wrong to
kill me, firmly believing that the disease
with which they had been afflicted,
had been sent by their God, as a punishment
for having killed Payne and the
others! The malady having now entirely
disappeared, they considered that
crime as expiated!</p>

<p>About two days after my return, there
was great excitement, in consequence
of the appearance of a ship! Seeing
the natives were very much displeased
at the circumstance, I concealed as well
as I could, the gladdening emotions
which filled my breast; and, surrounded
by about three hundred of them,
went round a point of land, when I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
distinctly saw a ship standing for the
land. The displeasure of the natives increased,
they demanded to know where
she came from, how many men she had
in her, &amp;c. I was compelled to tell
them that she was not coming to get
me, and even pretended to be afraid of
her approach, which pleased them much,
as they appeared determined I should
never leave them. At dusk she was so
near the land, that I saw them shorten
sail, and fondly anticipated the hour of
my deliverance as not far distant.</p>

<p>During the night, sleep was a stranger
to me, and with the most anxious
emotions did I anticipate a welcome reception
on board, and above all, a happy
and joyful landing on my native
shore. In the morning, Ludjuan went
with me to the beach, but alas! no ship
was in sight. She had vanished, and
with her had fled all my hopes of a
speedy deliverance. The kind reader
can perhaps form some idea of my disappointment.</p>

<p>The natives continued to be kind to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
me, and I was often complimented by
them for my knowledge of their language;
and the appearance of my person
had very much improved, my hair
and beard being long, and my skin turned
nearly as black as their own! I was
often importuned to have my ears bored
and stretched, but never gave my
consent, which much surprised them, it
being a great mark of beauty. They
begin at the age of four years, and perforate
the lower part of the ear, with a
sharp pointed stick; and as the ear
stretches, larger ones are inserted, until
it will hang nearly to their shoulders!
The larger the ear, the more beauty the
person possesses!</p>

<p>About a fortnight after I saw the ship
pass, Hussey came with his master, on
a visit. His disappointment was great,
and we could only cheer each other, by
hoping for the best, and wait patiently
the pleasure of Heaven.</p>

<p>Hussey again left me, but we parted
under less bodings of evil than before,
for the kindness of the natives began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
increase, and their suspicions to be allayed.</p>

<p>I will here acquaint the reader with
some of the means that I was induced to
make use of, to satisfy the cravings of
appetite. As the Island now was in a
state of almost entire famine, my daily
subsistence not amounting to more (upon
an average) than the substance of
one half a cocoanut each day. The
chief I lived with, having several cocoanut
trees that he was very choice of,
and which bore plentifully; I would
frequently, (after the natives in the hut
were all soundly asleep) take the opportunity
and get out of the hut unperceived,
and climb one of those trees,
(being very careful about making the
least noise, or letting any of them drop
to the ground, whereby I might be detected,)
and take the stem of one cocoanut
in my mouth, and one in each hand,
and in that manner make out to slide
down the tree, and would then (with
my prize) make the best of my way to
a bunch of bushes, at a considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
distance from the hut, where I would have
a sumptuous repast; and if any remained,
would secrete them, until by hunger,
I was drove to the necessity of revisiting
that place.</p>

<p>I made a practice of this for some
time, until the chief began to miss his
cocoanuts, and keep such watch, that I,
for fear of being detected, was obliged
to relinquish that mode of satisfying my
appetite.</p>

<p>A short time after this, I ventured to
take a cocoanut off the ground where
the natives had recently buried a person;
a deed which is strictly against
the laws of their religious principles, (if
it can be said that they have any,) and
a deed which the natives never dare to
do, for fear of displeasing their God
(Anit) under a certain length of time
after the person had been buried, and
then, the spot is only to be approached
by males.</p>

<p>Not twenty-four hours had elapsed
after I took the cocoanut, before they
missed it, and coming immediately to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
me, charged me with having taken it, telling
me that not a native on the Island
would have dared so much as to handle
it, for fear of the bad spirit, (Anit.)</p>

<p>I then told them that I had taken it,
but pleading ignorance in the case, and
promising never to do any thing of the
like again, and making it appear to them
that I was surprised at what they told
me of the bad spirit, and also that I believed
the same, they left me, after telling
me that if I ever handled another
of them, it would not only bring sickness
and death upon myself, but would bring
it upon the whole Island.</p>

<p>The reader will naturally suppose,
that my mind was considerably relieved
on their leaving me so soon, fearing
that something serious might be the result.</p>

<p>After this I was very careful how I
did any thing that I thought would in the
least displease, or irritate them, and
made myself content with the portion
they saw fit to give me.</p>

<p>I frequently fired a musket to please
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
them, by their request; and told them
if they would let me have some powder,
I would fire off the swivel, left by the
Globe. They consented, and collected
in great numbers, and after I had
loaded the gun with a heavy charge, I
told them they had better stand back.
They said I must set her on fire, and
tell them when she was going off, and
they would run! I however, touched
her off, when they instantly fell on their
faces in the greatest panick. When
their fears had subsided, they set up
howling and yelling with ecstacy!</p>

<p>They said, if they should have a battle,
I must carry that gun with me,
which would alone vanquish their enemies!</p>

<p>We were visited by eight or ten canoes,
from a distant Island, called Alloo.
They came to exchange presents with
our chiefs, and very soon a great quantity
of <i>pero</i>, &amp;c. was baked, and having
been inspected by the chiefs, to see that
it was in a proper state to be presented
to their visitors, it was given them to eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
As these people had never seen me
before, I was much annoyed by them.
During their stay, I was constantly surrounded;
my skin felt of, and often became
the sport of the more witty, because
my skin was not of so dark a hue
as their own, and more especially, as
my <em>ears</em> remained in the same form, as
when nature gave them to me. These
visitors, to my great satisfaction, did
not remain long with us.</p>

<p>Their mode of anchoring their canoes
is singular. One of them takes
the end of a line, and diving to the bottom,
secures it to a rock; and in the
same way do they dive down to cast it
off. I have seen them do this in five
fathoms of water.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>It was not until the 23d of December,
1825, that the prospects of being
relieved from my disagreeable situation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
began to brighten. Early in the morning
of that day, I was awakened by a
hooting and yelling of the natives, who
said, a vessel had anchored at the
head of the Island. They seemed alarmed,
and I need not assure the reader,
that my feelings were of a contrary nature.
Their God was immediately consulted,
as to the measures to pursue;
but as I was not allowed to be present
when he was invoked, I cannot say what
was the form of this ceremony, except
that cocoanut leaves were used. Their
God, however, approved the plan, which
was, that they should go to the vessel,
or near her, and swim on board, a few
at a time, until two hundred were on
board, and then a signal was to be given,
when they were to throw the persons
on board into the water, and kill
them. Two large canoes which would
carry fifty men each, were put in readiness,
but at first they refused to let me
accompany them, fearing that I would
inform of their having killed our men,
and they would be punished. I assured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
them that the vessel, having but two
masts, did not belong to my nation, and
I was certain I could not speak their
language.</p>

<p>They at length consented for me to
go. We arrived within a few miles of
the vessel at night, and early the following
morning, were joined by a number of
canoes, which made in all two hundred
men. It being squally in the forenoon,
we remained where we were, but when
it cleared up, the yells of the Indians
announced the approach of the vessel.
I had only time to see that it was really
an armed schooner, when I was secreted
with their women, about forty in
number, in a hut near the shore, and the
women had orders to watch me close,
that I did not get away.</p>

<p>A boat at this time from the schooner,
was seen approaching the shore. She
landed at about a hundred yards distant
from where I was confined; but it
being near night, I soon found she was
making the best of her way towards
the schooner. Night came, and I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
sent for by the principal chief, and
questioned closely concerning the schooner.
My fears and apprehensions were
now excited to a degree beyond human
expression, and the kind reader will
pardon all attempts to express them.</p>

<p>The natives seeing the whites so
bold, excited in them a fear which induced
them to flee the Island. Accordingly,
about midnight, the canoes were
launched, and I was carried to a remote
part of the Island, a distance of about
40 miles, where I remained until my
fortunate escape.</p>

<p>29th. Early in the morning, we discovered
a boat under sail, standing directly
for the place where we were;
the natives were considerably agitated
with fear, and engaged in planning some
method by which to overcome the people
in the boat, if they should come
where we were; and, as I expected,
the natives would hide me, as they had
heretofore done, I thought it best to offer
my services to assist them&mdash;I said I
would aid them in fighting the boat&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
crew&mdash;and that, as I could talk with
them, I would go to them, in advance
of the natives, deceive the crew, and
prevail on them to come on shore and
sit down, and for us to appear friendly
till in possession of their arms, then rise
upon the crew and kill them without
difficulty or hazard. Some of the natives
suspected that I should revolt to
the other party, and turn the current of
destruction on them; but the chief Luttuon
said he liked my plan much, and
would inquire of their God, and if he
found that I should be true to them, my
plan should be adopted. The inquiry
resulted in favor of my plan, and they
said I might go. The boat was now
within one hundred rods of the shore,
and Luttuon called me to him, oiled
my head and body with cocoanut oil,
and gave me my charge how to conduct.
I pledged myself to obey his orders.
My joy at this moment was great,
as the boat anchored near where we
were. I went to the beach, accompanied
by about one hundred of the smartest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
natives, whom I charged not to manifest
a hostile appearance. I hailed the
boat in English, and told the crew what
the calculations of the natives were, and
not to land unless they were well armed.
The officer of the boat replied that
he would be among them directly; and
in a few minutes they landed, (13 men
and 2 officers,) and when within a rod
of us, I ran to Lieut. H. Paulding, who
took me by the hand, asked if I was one
of the Globe&rsquo;s crew, and inquired my
name, &amp;c. &amp;c. We then retreated to
the boat, facing the natives, who all kept
their seats, excepting the one I called
father, who came down among us, and
took hold of me to carry me back, but
desisted on having a pistol presented to
his breast.</p>

<p>Lieut. Hiram Paulding, of the Navy,
for such was the name of this gentlemanly
officer, informed me that the vessel,
was the U.&nbsp;S. Schooner Dolphin, sent
on purpose to rescue us, and commanded
by Lieut. Com&rsquo;t. John Percival.</p>

<p>After expressing my gratitude as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
as I was able, to Heaven, which had furnished
the means of my deliverance, I
acquainted Mr. Paulding, that the only
survivor of the Globe, except myself,
was Cyrus M. Hussey; who was held
in bondage upon a neighbouring Island.
After the boat&rsquo;s crew had taken some
refreshment, we left the landing place,
and soon arrived at the place where
Hussey lived. The natives had concealed
him, but after some threatenings
from us, restored him, and we were received
on board of the Dolphin, and
treated in the most kind and hospitable
manner.</p>

<p>Our hair was now cut, and we were
shaved. Our appearance must have
been truly ludicrous, our hair having
been growing twenty-two months, untouched
by the razor or scissors.</p>

<p>Our joy and happiness on finding ourselves
on board an <em>American Man-of-War</em>,
and seeing &ldquo;the star spangled banner,&rdquo;
once more floating in the air, we
will not attempt to describe. Suffice it
to say, that none can form a true estimate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of our feelings, except it be those
who have been suddenly and unexpectedly
rescued from pain and peril, and
threatening death. In the afternoon
the Captain wished me to go on shore
with him, as an interpreter. We accordingly
went, and passed over to the
village on the other side of the Island,
where we had an interview with a woman
of distinction, (the men having fled,
being principally absent with the chiefs
at Alloo.) The captain informed her
he wished to see the chiefs, and requested
her to send for them that night,
that he might visit them in the morning,
and make them some presents. We
then returned to the vessel; and the
following day, Dec. 1st, went on shore
for the purpose of seeing the chiefs, but
could not obtain an interview with them.
The captain informed the natives that
he must see the chiefs, and that he
would wait another day, but if disappointed
then, he should be compelled
to use coercive means. They immediately
sent another messenger after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
them, and we returned on board, accompanied
by several of the natives, among
whom was Ludjuan. The captain
made him several presents, and informed
him they were given as a compensation
for saving my life. Shortly
after, the natives went on shore.</p>

<p>The next morning, Dec. 2d, the captain
sent me on shore, to ascertain
whether the chiefs had returned, and I
was informed by the natives that they
had, and were then at a house half a
mile distant. This intelligence having
been communicated to the captain, he
went on shore, and took myself and
Hussey for interpreters; but we found
on our arrival, that the natives had been
practising a piece of deception&mdash;the
chiefs not having returned. Very much
displeased at this perfidious treatment,
the captain made a demand of the chiefs
before sunset, threatening, if it were
not complied with, to go on shore with
fifty men, well armed, and destroy every
person he could find. This threat
threw the natives into consternation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and immediately another messenger was
despatched for the chiefs. The natives
were so alarmed, that they soon sent off
three or four more messengers; and
we returned on board to dine. After
dinner, I went on shore with Mr. Paulding,
the first Lieutenant, and some of
the under officers, for the purpose of
shooting birds. After rambling round
the Island for some time, we discovered
a number of natives quickly approaching
us from the lower part of the Island;
and supposing the chiefs were with
them, we sat down to await their arrival;
but before they came to us, a signal
was set on board the schooner, for
us to return, which was immediately
obeyed, without waiting for an interview
with the natives. Early on the next
morning, I was sent ashore to ascertain
whether the chiefs had arrived, and soon
found that they had, and were in a hut,
waiting to receive a visit from the captain,
who, I informed them, would come
on shore after breakfast, to have a <em>talk</em>
with them, and also to bestow some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
presents. Accordingly, the captain,
with myself and Hussey, repaired to
the hut, where we found them sitting,
and ready to commune with us.</p>

<p>The captain told them he had been
sent out by the <em>Head Chief</em> of his country,
to look for the men that had been
left there by the ship Globe&mdash;that he
had been informed they murdered all
but two&mdash;that, as it was their first offence
of the kind, their ignorance would
plead an excuse&mdash;but if they should ever
kill or injure another white man, who
was from any vessel or wreck, or who
might be left among them, our country
would send a naval force, and exterminate
every soul on the Island; and also
destroy their fruit trees, provisions, &amp;c.
and that if they would always treat white
men kindly, they never would receive
any injury from them, but would have
their kindness and hospitality reciprocated.
He also adverted to the practice
of stealing, lying, and other immoralities;
stating to the natives that these
crimes are abhorred and punished in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
our country; and that murder is punished
with death. He then sent me to
the boat, lying at the beach, to bring
three tomahawks, one axe, a bag of
beads, and a number of cotton handkerchiefs,
which were presented to the
chiefs. He also gave them two hogs,
and a couple of cats, with injunctions
not to destroy them, that they might
multiply. The captain caused potatoes,
corn, pumpkins, and many valuable
seeds to be planted, and gave the natives
instructions how to raise and preserve
them. He then explained to them
that these acts of kindness and generosity
were extended, because they saved
us alive, and had taken care of us while
among them. This conversation with
the natives being ended, we went on
board, dined, and the captain and Hussey
went again on shore. The first
Lieutenant made preparations for cruising
in the launch, round the Island, to
make topographical surveys, who took
me with him, as interpreter, and about
4 o&rsquo;clock, we commenced a cruise with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
a design to sail up an inlet or inland sea;
but the wind blowing fresh, and having
a head sea, at 12 o&rsquo;clock we anchored
for the night.</p>

<p>Dec. 4th. At sunrise, we found ourselves
not more than a mile from the
place where we crossed over the evening
before; and immediately getting
under weigh, and rowing to the westward,
we soon came to the place where
the Globe&rsquo;s station had been; anchored,
and went on shore, for the purpose
of disinterring the bones of Comstock,
who had been buried there, and to obtain
a cutlass, which was buried with
him; but before we had accomplished
the undertaking, the schooner got under
weigh, and soon anchored abreast
of us, at the same place where the
Globe&rsquo;s provisions were landed. The
captain and Hussey immediately came
on shore to view the place; but as I
caught cold the preceding night, by lying
exposed in our launch, I was excused
from serving further with Mr. Paulding
in making surveys, and Hussey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
supplied my place. Soon after, I went
on board with the captain, carrying with
me the skull of the person we had dug
up, and the cutlass, intending to convey
them to America.</p>

<p>After dinner, the captain made a trip
in the gig, to Alloo, taking me for his
interpreter, where we arrived in half an
hour, and soon travelled up to the village.
The natives received us with
marks of gladness, and in a short time
the house at which we stopped was surrounded
by them, who came undoubtedly
for the purpose of gratifying their
curiosity, by gazing at us. We remained
at the village about two hours, during
which time we had considerable
talk with two of the chief women, and
made some small presents to the people,
such as beads, &amp;c. They did not
treat us as they usually do visitors, with
fruit, &amp;c. there being at that time what we
call a famine, which in their language,
is Ingathah.</p>

<p>After having taken leave of the natives,
and walked about half the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
distance to the shore, we stopped to refresh
ourselves under a fine cool shade.
While in conversation on the manners
and customs of the natives, an old man
and woman approached us, who had acted
towards me, during my residence among
them, as father and mother. I
immediately made them and their kindness
to me known to the captain, who,
in consideration of their humane treatment,
rewarded them with a few beads
and a handkerchief, for which they appeared
thankful and grateful&mdash;telling
them at the same time, the presents
were to recompense their hospitality
to me, and enjoining on them at all
times to be friendly to the whites, and a
reward would certainly await them. It
being near the close of the day, we left
Alloo, and having a fair wind, reached
the schooner before dark.</p>

<p>The next morning, Dec. 5th, being
very pleasant, all hands were employed
in procuring wood for the schooner&mdash;some
in cutting it down, and others in
boating it off. Our carpenter had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
engaged for a few days, at Milly; to
instruct and assist the natives in repairing
a canoe. The distance was four or
five miles, and the captain wanting the
carpenter, set sail for Milly in his gig,
and soon arrived there; where he learned
that the carpenter had repaired the
canoe, to the great satisfaction of the
natives, who expressed a strong desire
that he might be permitted to remain among
them on the Island; but the captain
informed them he could not spare
him. When the natives saw the carpenter
packing up his tools, they expressed
to me an expectation that the
tools would be left with them as a present.
We left the natives, and reached
the schooner a little before sunset; the
captain feeling anxious for the fate of
the launch, as nothing yet had been
heard of the fortune which had attended
her, or the men in her.</p>

<p>Dec. 6th. Having procured a sufficient
supply of wood, though our supply
of provisions was hardly sufficient
for the voyage, and the launch having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
returned, at about 10 A.&nbsp;M. we weighed
anchor and proceeded to the place
called Milly, where we anchored for the
purpose of planting some seeds, and taking
a last farewell of the chiefs and
their people. The captain went immediately
on shore, taking Hussey for his
interpreter. He was gone till nearly
night, when he returned, bringing with
him <i>Luttuon</i> and several other natives.
The captain gave orders to beat to quarters,
to exhibit the men to the natives,
and explain to them the manner of our
fighting. Those untutored children of
nature, seemed highly gratified with the
manoeuvres, but were most delighted
with the music, probably the first of the
kind they ever heard. We informed
them we always have such music when
we are fighting an enemy. The natives
were then landed, and we immediately
made sail for the head of the Island, intending
to cruise around the other
shores of it, for the purpose of making
surveys, and constructing a map of it.
We stood eastward till nearly morning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
then altered our course and headed towards
the Island.</p>

<p>During the following day, Dec. 7th,
having favorable winds and weather, we
made a regular survey of the whole
length of the groupe, before sunset.&mdash;The
captain now steered N.&nbsp;W. to endeavour
to discover other Islands which
the natives had often described to me,
during my abode with them. They
said they had frequently visited ten or
twelve different Islands in their canoes,
and that the people who inhabit them,
all speak the same language, which is
the same as their own, and that the Islands
lie about one day&rsquo;s sail from each
other.</p>

<p>Dec. 8. The weather pleasant and
fair; about 9 o&rsquo;clock, A.&nbsp;M. we saw
land ahead, and passed it on the windward
side, then varied our course and
sailed to the leeward of the Island; but
night coming on, we were obliged to defer
landing till morning. The captain
then attempted to reach the shore in
the gig, but was not able to land, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
account of the surf. After he returned on
board, we made sail, cruising farther to
the leeward, in hopes of finding a place
to anchor, but in this we were disappointed,
not being able to find bottom
thirty yards from the rocks. However,
at high water, the captain, at imminent
hazard in passing the surf, succeeded
in landing. He had previously given
orders to me and Hussey, not to let
the natives know that we could converse
with, or understand them, but to be attentive
to every thing that might pass among
them, to ascertain whether their
intentions and dispositions were hostile
or friendly. After landing, the captain
and Hussey visited the house where the
head chief, or king of all those Islands
lived, of whom I had formerly heard so
much, while I was on the Mulgraves.&mdash;They
continued with him about two
hours, were treated well, and discovering
nothing unfriendly in the natives,
the captain told Hussey he might make
them acquainted with his knowledge of
their language, by conversing with them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
The king, on hearing Hussey speaking
in the language of the natives, appeared
at first so frightened and agitated, that
he could scarcely reply; but by degrees
became composed, and inquired of Hussey
where he learned their language, and
why he had not spoken to them immediately
on coming ashore. Hussey then
informed him he was one of the two
persons that had been on the Mulgraves,
(in their language, Milly,) and that the
other person (myself) was on board the
schooner&mdash;that the schooner had been
there after us, that we left the Mulgraves
the day before, and had then visited
that Island for the purpose of examining
it, &amp;c. &amp;c. The king had long
before heard of our being at the Mulgraves,
and told Hussey he had been
repairing his canoe, in order to go to
those Islands, with a view to induce us
to live with him, who, had that been the
case, would undoubtedly have used us
well. The king was about 70 years of
age, and had a daughter on the Island
where we had resided, wife to Luttuon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
He inquired if his daughter was alive
and well, with tears in his eyes and
trembling form, for it was a long time
since he had received any intelligence
of her; and hearing of her welfare so
unexpectedly, quite overcame the good
old father&rsquo;s feelings. And here the
reader will observe, that the pure and
unaffected emotions produced by parental
affection, are similar among all
the human species, whether civilized or
savage. The natives of the Island we
were then visiting, may be ranked with
those that have made the fewest approaches
towards the refined improvements
of enlightened nations, yet the
ground work of humanity was discovered
to be the same; and the solicitude
of a fond father for a beloved child, was
manifested in a manner which would not
disgrace those who move in the most
elevated circles of civilized life. The
old king expressed his regret that he
had not visited the Mulgraves during
our stay there, was very sorry we were
about to return to America, and used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
all the force of native eloquence, to
persuade us to continue with him. He
inquired if we had got the whale boat he
had heard of our having at the Mulgraves.
Hussey informed him it was
on board the schooner, and the swivel
likewise. The captain then informed
the king that he wanted cocoanuts and
bup, which were obtained; and in return,
the captain gave the natives some
beads and handkerchiefs. The captain
then went on board the schooner, made
sail, standing a N.&nbsp;W. course, in pursuit
of another Island.</p>

<p>Dec 9th. About 10 o&rsquo;clock in the
forenoon, we discovered land ahead and
off our lee bow. About 2 o&rsquo;clock, P.&nbsp;M.
we arrived near the land, hove the
schooner to, and sent two boats ashore,
to get provisions. At sunset the boats
returned, loaded with cocoanuts and
bup. We hoisted up our boats, and with
a strong breeze, it being the inclement
season of the year, prosecuted our voyage
to the Sandwich Islands, &amp; had much
boisterous weather during the passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
On Jan. 8th, 1826, we expected to
make one of the Sandwich Islands, called
Bird&rsquo;s Island, but night came on before
we discovered it. But early on the
following morning, we saw land about
four leagues to the leeward, and bore
down to the Island for the purpose of
sending a boat ashore, to kill seals.&mdash;We
arrived near the landing place,
hove to, and the captain with six men
went ashore in the whale boat. We
now stood off from the shore for about
an hour, then tacked and stood in, for
the boat to come off. The wind had
increased to almost a gale, and continuing
to blow harder, when we were within
a quarter of a mile of the Island, not
discovering any thing of the boat, we
veered off again, and continued tacking
till night came on, but saw nothing of
the boat or her crew. About 9 or 10
o&rsquo;clock, the wind abated, and we found
ourselves two leagues to the leeward of
the Island, where we lay to all night under
easy sail, anxiously waiting for the
approach of morning, in hopes then to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
learn the fate of the captain and men
who had gone on shore. At length the
horizon was lighted by the dawn of day,
which was succeeded by the opening
of a very pleasant morning. We immediately
made all sail for the Island, but
having a head wind, we did not arrive
at the landing till near the middle of the
day. A boat was sent on shore to learn
what had befallen the crew of the whale
boat, and shortly returned with all the
men except the captain and one man
that could not swim. We ascertained,
that in attempting to come off through
the surf, they were swamped and lost
their boat. We a second time sent the
boat ashore with means to get the captain
and other man, who were soon
brought on board. We now made sail
and steered our course for Woahoo, one
of the Sandwich Islands, and nothing
very material occurring on our passage,
we anchored in the harbour of that Island
on the 14th. On the 16th procured
a supply of fresh provisions. On the
19th, Hussey and myself went on shore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
for the purpose of rambling round the
Island, but nothing occurred worthy of
notice.</p>

<p>Our foremast being found rotten a few
feet below the top, it was deemed necessary
to take it out for repairs, which
required the daily employment of the
carpenter and others for some time.&mdash;On
the 27th, the captain received a letter,
giving intelligence that the ship
London had been driven ashore at an
Island not far distant from Woahoo.&mdash;As
the Dolphin&rsquo;s foremast was out, the
captain was under the necessity of pressing
the brig Convoy, of Boston, and
putting on board of her about 90 of his
own men, taking with him 2 of his lieutenants
and some under officers, he sailed
to the assistance of the ship London.</p>

<p>Feb, 3d, the brig Convoy returned laden
with a part of the cargo of the London,
and the specie which was in her at
the time of her going ashore, under the
command of our 2d lieutenant, leaving the
remainder of her cargo in another vessel,
under the command of Capt. Percival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Feb. 5th. The captain returned with
the residue of the London&rsquo;s cargo, and
the officers and crew of that ship. After
the cargo of the London had been
secured, we were employed in finishing
the repairs on our foremast, which were
completed on the 21st; and we commenced
rigging.</p>

<p>Feb. 26th. On the morning of this
day, permission was granted to a number
of our crew, to go on shore. In the
afternoon, Hussey and myself went and
took a walk. About 4 or 5 o&rsquo;clock, I
observed a great collection of natives,
and on inquiring the reason, learned
that several of the Dolphin&rsquo;s crew, joined
by some from other ships lying in
port, had made an assault upon Mr.
Bingham, the missionary, in consequence
of ill will towards that gentleman,
strongly felt by some of the sailors,
but for what particular reason, I
did not distinctly ascertain. They carried
their revenge so far, that they not
only inflicted blows upon Mr. Bingham,
but attacked the house of a chief. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
natives, some with cutlasses, and others
with guns, repelled the unjustifiable attack;
and during the affray, several of
our men were slightly injured, and one
badly wounded, whose life was despaired
of for some time. The offenders
were arrested, sent on board, and put
in irons.</p>

<p>On the next day, 27th, Mr. Bingham
came on board with the captain and witnesses
against the men engaged the
preceding day, in the assault on shore.
After a fair examination of evidence in
the case, the aggressors were properly
punished, and ordered to their duty.&mdash;The
whale ships now began to arrive
for the purpose of recruiting, and for
some particular reasons, several of the
captains of those ships requested captain
Percival to remain at the Island as a
protection to them, till they could obtain
the necessary supplies, and resume
their cruises. From the present date,
nothing of importance occurred that
would be interesting to readers, till April
3d, when great preparations were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
made on board the Dolphin, to give a
splendid entertainment to the young
king. The gig and second cutter were
employed in the morning, to borrow
signals from the different ships in the
harbour, in order to dress out the
schooner in a fanciful style. About 11
o&rsquo;clock, the gig and second cutter were
sent ashore for the king and several
chiefs and natives of distinction, who
were soon conveyed on board. The
yards were manned, and a general salute
fired. After partaking of as good
a dinner as our resources and the means
within our reach would afford, the king
and his attendants were disembarked
under the honour of another salute.&mdash;During
the remainder of this month, the
events which transpired, were principally
of an ordinary cast, and not thought
worthy of record.</p>

<p>May 3d. This day we were employed
in bending sails; and from this date
to the 11th, the necessary preparations
were made to commence our homeward
voyage. This day (11th,) the pilot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
came on board, and for the last time we
weighed our anchors in the harbour of
Woahoo. While retiring from the shore
we were saluted with 21 guns from the
fort. We hove about, returned the salute,
and then resumed our destined
course, and bid a last adieu to Woahoo,
after a tedious and protracted stay of about
four months.</p>

<p>From the time of our departure, on
the 11th of May, from Woahoo, nothing
of importance transpired till the 12th of
June. On the morning of this day we
discovered the Island Toobowy; and
at 9 o&rsquo;clock saw a sail, which proved to
be a whale ship. At half past 2 came
to anchor at a convenient place near
the Island, and sent a boat ashore,
which returned at night with two natives,
who gave us a description of the
harbour, and directions how to enter it;
and as our mainmast was injured, we entered
it to make the necessary repairs.
On the 13th, we beat up the harbour,
and at 3 o&rsquo;clock anchored, where we
continued repairing our mast, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
procuring wood and water, till the 22d;
when we weighed anchor and made sail
for Valparaiso, favoured with fine weather
and good winds. July 18th, made
the Island of Massafuero, and passed it
about midnight. On the 19th, in the
forenoon, made the Island of Juanfernandez;
and at 11 P.&nbsp;M. on the following
day, discovered the land at the
south of Valparaiso. On the 22d, beat
up the harbour, and at 2 o&rsquo;clock on the
morning of the 23d, came to anchor.&mdash;At
Valparaiso, we learned that the frigate
United States was at Callao; and
after getting a supply of provisions, we
sailed for Callao on the 9th of August,
and arrived on the 24th. Here we
found the United States, lying under the
Island of Lorenzo, with several English
ships of war.</p>

<p>On the 26th, the Dolphin in company
with the United States, passed over to
Callao; and Sept. 1st, I and the crew
of the Dolphin were transferred to the
United States.</p>

<p>Sept. 10th. All the men that had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
been transferred from the Dolphin to
the United States, had liberty to go to
Lima; at 12 o&rsquo;clock we went on shore,
and at 4 P.&nbsp;M. entered the gates of the
city. I employed my time while on
shore, in roving about the city, and
viewing the various objects it presents;
and on the 13th returned on board the
United States. We were detained here
till the 16th of December, when we sailed
for Valparaiso, and having a pleasant
passage, arrived on the 6th of January,
where we were happy to find, for
our relief, the Brandywine. From the
8th to the 24th, all hands were engaged
in preparing the ship for her homeward
voyage; when at 9 o&rsquo;clock we weighed
our larboard anchor, and at 1 P.&nbsp;M. were
under sail, passing out of the harbour,
when the Cambridge, (an English 74,)
then lying in the harbour, gave us 3
cheers, which we returned with 3 times
3; she then saluted us with 13 guns,
which we returned with the same number,
and then proceeded to sea.</p>

<p>Being favoured with fine weather and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
good winds, we had a prosperous voyage
to Cape Horn, and arrived off the
pitch on the 7th of Feb. and passed
round with a pleasant breeze. In prosecuting
our voyage home, off the mouth
of the river Rio de la Plata, and along
the coast of Brazil, we had rough weather
and thick fogs. On the 6th we made
the land and harbour of St. Salvador,
and about 9 o&rsquo;clock came to anchor.&mdash;On
the 7th we fired a salute for the fort,
which was returned.</p>

<p>We were now employed in watering
our ship, and making other preparations
for continuing our voyage homeward;
and on the 15th got under weigh, with
a fine breeze.</p>

<p>April 1st. At 10 o&rsquo;clock, made the
Island of Barbadoes, and at 1 P.&nbsp;M.
came to anchor, where we lay till 5 P.&nbsp;M.
on the 3d, when we got under weigh,
and sailed down the Island to St. Thomas,
where we sent a boat ashore, and
after transacting the business for which
we stopped, made sail on the 9th for
the port of New-York. On the 21st,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
made the highland of Neversink; at 2
P.&nbsp;M. took a pilot on board, but owing
to fogs and calms, did not arrive to the
port of destination till 1 P.&nbsp;M. next day,
when we anchored opposite the West
Battery, with a thankful heart that I was
once more within the United States.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>I will now proceed to give the reader
some account of the Islands I visited,
and of the manners and customs of the
natives, and shall endeavour to be as
candid and correct as possible.</p>

<p>The Mulgrave Islands are situated
between 5 and 6 degrees north latitude,
and between 170 and 174 degrees of
east longitude. They are about 50
miles in length, and lie in the form of a
semi-circle, forming a kind of inland sea
or lake; the distance across it being about
20 miles. The land is narrow,
and the widest place is probably not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
more than half a mile. On the north
side of the group are several inlets or
passages, of sufficient depth to admit
the free navigation of the largest ships;
and if explored, excellent harbours
would in all probability be found. In
the inland sea are numerous beds of
coral, which appear to be constantly
forming and increasing. These coral
beds are seen at low water, but are all
overflowed at high tide. The whole
group is entirely destitute of mountains,
and even hills, the highest land not being
more than six feet above the level
of the sea at high water. By the accounts
given me from the natives, it appears
that some parts have been overflowed
by the sea. Their being so low,
makes the navigation near them very
dangerous in the night, both because
they would not be easily seen, and because
the water is very deep quite to
the shores; and a place for anchoring
can scarcely be found on the outside of
the Island.</p>

<p>The air of these Islands is pure, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the climate hot; but the heat is rendered
less oppressive by the trade winds,
which blow constantly, and keep the atmosphere
healthful and salubrious for so
low a latitude.</p>

<p>The soil, in general, is productive of
little besides trees and shrubs, and most
of it is covered with rough coral stones.</p>

<p>The productions are breadfruit in its
proper season, and cocoanuts, which
they have throughout the year; and a
kind of fruit different from any that
grows in America, which the natives
call Bup&mdash;all growing spontaneously.
Of the leaves of the trees the women
manufacture very elegant mats, which
they wear as blankets and clothing; of
the bark of a vine they make men&rsquo;s
clothing; and of the husks of the cocoa
they make ropes and rigging for their
canoes, and for almost every other purpose.
The waters round the Islands
abound with fish, and the natives are
very expert in catching them.</p>

<p>There are no animals on the Islands,
excepting <em>rats</em>; and by these little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
quadrupeds they are literally overrun.</p>

<p>The number of all the inhabitants,
men, women, and children, is probably
between five and six hundred.</p>

<p>The following may be given as prominent
characteristics of the natives.&mdash;They
are in general, well made and
handsome&mdash;very indolent and superstitious.
They are morose, treacherous,
ferociously passionate, and unfriendly to
all other natives. When they are not
fishing, or otherwise employed, they are
generally travelling about, and visiting
each other. They have no salutations
when they meet, but sit down without
exchanging a word of civility for some
minutes; but after a silent pause, the
head of the family, if there is any thing
in the house to eat, presents it to his
guests, who, when they have eaten sufficiently,
if there are any <em>fragments</em> left,
are very careful to secure them and carry
them off when they return home;
and the host would regard it as an imposition,
if his visitors were to neglect
this important trait of politeness, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
fashionable item in etiquette. They
accustom themselves to frequent bathing;
and commence with their children
on the day of their birth, and continue
the practice twice a day, regularly, till
they are two years old. They do this
to invigorate the system, and render the
skin of their children thick and tough by
exposure. Their living consists simply
of breadfruit, cocoanuts, and bup;
but cocoanuts are all they can depend
on the year round&mdash;the two other articles
being common only a part of the year.</p>

<p>Their diversions consist in singing,
dancing, and beating time with their
arms, in a manner similar to the amusements
of the natives at the Sandwich
Islands; in which they appear to take
great delight.</p>

<p>They wear their hair long, and tie it
up in a kind of bow on the top of the
head, and this is all the covering they
have for their heads. The men have
long beards. One part of their dress
makes a singular and ludicrous appearance,
which resembles two <em>horse tails</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
suspended from the waist, one before
and the other behind. The women&rsquo;s
dress consists of two mats, about the
size of a small pocket-handkerchief,
which they tie round them like an apron.</p>

<p>I never saw any form of marriage among
them, but when a couple are desirous
of being united, their parents have
a talk together on the subject, and if the
parties all agree to the union, the couple
commence living together as man
and wife; and I never knew of an instance
of separation between them after
they had any family. In a few instances
polygamy prevailed.</p>

<p>The following will give a pretty correct
idea of their funeral rites and solemnities:</p>

<p>When a person dies, the inhabitants
of the village assemble together, and
commence drumming and singing, halloing
and yelling; and continue their
boisterous lamentations for about 48
hours, day and night, relieving each
other as they require. This they do,
because they imagine it is diverting to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the person deceased. They bury the
body at a particular place back of their
houses, and use mats for a coffin. After
the ceremony of interment is performed,
they plant two cocoanut trees, one
at the head and the other at the feet of
the buried person. But if the trees ever
bear fruit, the women are prohibited
from eating thereof, for fear of displeasing
the bad spirit, <i>Anit</i>. And here it
may not be inappropriate to remind the
reader that Eve ate of the forbidden
fruit, notwithstanding she knew it would
displease the <span class="smcap">Good Spirit</span>.</p>

<p>In their personal appearance, the natives
are about the middle size, with
broad faces, flat noses, black hair and
eyes, and large mouths.</p>

<p>In relation to literature, they are as
ignorant as it is possible for people to
be, having not the most distant idea of
letters.</p>

<p>Concerning the religion of the untaught
natives of the Mulgraves, the following
remarks will give all the knowledge
I am in possession of:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
They believe there is an invisible
spirit that rules and governs all events,
and that he is the cause of all their sickness
and distress;&mdash;consequently they
consider him to be a very bad being.&mdash;But
they have no belief in a good spirit,
nor have they any modes of worship.&mdash;It
is a prevalent opinion among them,
when any are sick, that the bad spirit
rests upon them; and they believe that
particular manoeuvres and a form of
words, performed round and said over
the sick, will induce <i>Anit</i>, the bad spirit,
to cease from afflicting, and leave the
unfortunate sufferers. With regard to a
future state of existence, they believe that
the <em>shadow</em>, or what survives the body,
is, after death, entirely happy; that it
roves about at pleasure, and takes much
delight in beholding everything that is
transacted in this world;&mdash;and as they
consider the world as an extensive plain,
they suppose the disembodied spirits
travel quite to the edge of the skies,
where they think white people live, and
then back again to their native Isles;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and at times they fancy they can hear
the spirits of departed friends whistling
round their houses, and noticing all the
transactions of the living. Singular as
some of these notions and opinions may
appear, there is much to be met with
in Christendom equally at variance with
reason; and I have heard from the pulpit,
in New-England, the following language:
&ldquo;I have no doubt in my own
mind that the blessed in Heaven look
down on all the friends and scenes they
left behind, and are fully sensible of all
things that take place on earth!&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>This chapter, and the concluding remarks
of the narrative, will be collated
from a Journal kept by Cyrus M. Hussey;
and if there appear occasionally
some incidents similar to those recorded
in the preceding account, it is believed
the value and interest of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
history will not be diminished by them.&mdash;Hussey
commences thus:</p>

<p>About the last of April, myself and
Lay were separated, destined to different
Islands, not knowing whether we
should ever see each other again. At
night we arrived at an Island, and hauled
up our canoe. We found but few
natives, but among the number was the
mother of the chief with whom I lived.
She was very inquisitive respecting me,
and talked so incessantly through the
night that I could not sleep. The next
morning we were employed in gathering
breadfruit, for the purpose of curing
it for the winter. This employment
continued about three months, during
which time I was very uneasy about my
situation. At intervals of leisure, when
the old chief had no particular engagements
to engross his attention, he would
launch his canoe and go and search for
fish; but my shoes having been taken
from me, whenever I was employed
round the rough shores of the Island,
my feet were so wounded that I could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
hardly walk. The natives now commenced
the destruction of my clothing,
and not being able to converse with
them, I found it very difficult to preserve
my apparel. They often requested
me to divest myself of my clothing,
and dress as they did, or rather not dress
at all. I made signs that the sun would
burn me, if I should expose myself to
its scorching rays. When they found
that persuasion would not induce me to
divest myself of clothing, they began to
destroy my clothes, by tearing them in
pieces. It was some time before I could
understand their language, so as to inform
them that the sun would burn my
back; and being robbed of my clothes,
the powerful influence of the sun soon
scorched me to such a degree that I
could scarcely lie down or take any rest.</p>

<p>About the latter part of July, William
Lay and others came to the Island in a
canoe, to see me, being the first interview
we had enjoyed since our separation,
which was about three months previous.
Lay informed me that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
natives had taken his bible from him and
torn it up, and threatened his life. He
informed me that it seemed to him as
though he was robbed of that comfort
which none in a christian land are deprived
of. We were soon parted; he
in a canoe was taken to an Island by the
natives called <i>Dilabu</i>, and I went to my
employment, repairing a canoe which
was on the stocks. After I had finished
the canoe, the natives prepared a quantity
of bread fruit and fish for the chiefs,
and on the following morning we set sail
for an Island called <i>Milly</i>, one of the
largest in the group, at which resides
the principal chief. We arrived just at
night and were cordially received by
the natives, who had assembled on the
beach in great numbers, for the purpose
of getting some fish which the old chief
had brought with him. He then hauled
his canoe on shore; and I had again the
pleasure of seeing my fellow sufferer,
William Lay, after a month&rsquo;s separation.
Since our first meeting we were not allowed
to converse much together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
The old chief tarried at this Island
but a short time, and Lay and myself
were once more separated. The old
chief, his family, and myself, returned
to the Island which we had left two or
three days before, called, in the language
of the natives, <i>Tabarawort</i>; and
he and his family commenced gathering
bread fruit. As the old man with whom
I lived had charge of several small Islands,
we found it difficult to gather the
fruit as fast as it ripened, so that a considerable
part fell to the ground and
perished. In the mean time, while we
were employed in gathering in the fruits
of the earth, news came to the Island,
to inform the chief with whom I lived,
that it was the intention of the highest
chiefs to destroy us both, (that is myself
and Lay,) because a severe sickness
prevailed among them, and they being
superstitious, supposed we were the occasion
of it. I informed them that <em>we</em>
could not have been the cause of the
sickness, as no such sickness prevailed
in our country, and that I never before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
had seen a similar disease. But still
they talked very hard about us; and
the highest chief sent to the chief I lived
with, to have me brought to the Island
of Milly, where Lay lived, in order
that we might be killed together. Preparations
having been made, the old
chief, whom I called father, with his
family and myself, set sail the next morning
for Milly, where we arrived about
sun set. He immediately went to see
the chief of Milly, to inquire the circumstances
relating to the necessity of
taking our lives, leaving me and the rest
of the family in the canoe. I shortly
perceived William Lay and his master
coming towards the canoe, which produced
sensations hard to be described.
Affectionate and sympathizing reader,
what must have been our feelings and
conversation at that moment, when
nothing seemingly was presented to our
view but <em>death</em>? We were allowed an
interview of only a few minutes, when
we were again separated.</p>

<p>My master soon returned to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
canoe, and entered into very earnest conversation
with his family, which, at the
time, I did not fully understand; but
found afterwards it was a relation to his
family of his interview with the natives
on the subject of taking our lives; and
that if they killed me, they would first
have to kill him, (my master,) which
they were unwilling to do. My kind
old master told them he had preserved
me, and always should. Night now coming
on, I lay down to sleep, but fear had
taken such possession of my mind, that
the night was spent in wakeful anxiety.</p>

<p>The next morning I asked leave of
my master to visit Lay, which he readily
gave. I set out for the hut in company
with my master&rsquo;s son; but on approaching
it, Lay called out to me, to
inform me that I must not come&mdash;that
the natives did not like to have us together.
On my turning to go back,
Lay&rsquo;s master called to me to come. I
went and sat down, and entered into
conversation with Lay, to ascertain
what the intention of the natives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
towards us were. He told me it was the
design of the high chief to kill us. I observed
to him, that we were in the hands
of the natives; still there was a higher
and more powerful Hand that could protect
us, if it were the Divine pleasure so
to do. I then bade him farewell, and returned
to the canoe, never expecting to
see each other again till we should meet
on the tranquil ocean of eternity.</p>

<p>My master being now ready to return
to his Island, the canoe was launched,
and we set sail, and arrived the same
night, having been absent two days.&mdash;The
natives expressed much joy on seeing
me return, and asked many questions
respecting the chief of Milly; but
as I was unable to speak their language
intelligibly, I could give them but little
information. We then went on with
our work as usual, which was fishing,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>After having been at this Island some
time, my master&rsquo;s wife manifested an
inclination to go and visit her friends,
who lived at an Island called in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
language <i>Luguonewort</i>. After a successful
excursion in fishing, we cooked
a part, and took some breadfruit, and
embarked, agreeably to the wishes of
my master&rsquo;s wife, and arrived at Luguonewort
in two days. The natives of
that Island gave us a cordial reception.
We hauled up our canoe and remained
some time among them. After our agreeable
visit was ended, we returned
to the other Island, found the natives
well, and that good care had been taken
by the chief&rsquo;s mother, an old woman to
whom the superintendence of things
had been left.</p>

<p>About six months after the massacre
of my shipmates, the brother of the native
in whose possession I was, came to
the Island, and informed us that a ship
had been seen to pass a day or two before,
and that it caused great disturbance
among the chiefs&mdash;that they
thought it was the ship that left the Islands,
(the Globe,) and that she was in
search of us. My old master immediately
prepared his canoe to visit the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
chiefs, and he wanted also to inquire of
me what I thought respecting the ship.
We loaded our canoe and made sail for
Milly, where the chiefs were. We arrived
at night, and found a great number
of natives collected on the beach, to
see if we had any fish. We hauled up
our canoe for the night, and the natives
began to question me about the ship.&mdash;I
told them I did not know, concluding
it would be good policy to say but little
on the subject. The natives crowded
round me in great numbers; and I did
not see Lay till he came to me. I inquired
of him what he had seen, and he
informed me that there had been a ship
in sight about half an hour before sun
set, and that she was near enough for
him to see them take in their fore and
mizen top gallant sails, but could give
no definite account of her, as she was
soon out of sight. We were not allowed
to be together long; and I went to
rest as usual, but could not sleep.&mdash;&ldquo;Hope
springs eternal in the human
breast&rdquo;&mdash;and hope that the ship which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
had been seen had come to deliver us
from savages and transport us to our
native country and dear friends, had an
influence on my feelings more powerful
than sleep, and imagination was busy
through the night in picturing scenes of
future happiness.</p>

<p>But the prospect of our being released
from our unpleasant situation was not
very flattering. Early next morning I
asked and obtained permission from my
master, to pay a visit to Lay, before passing
round to the opposite side of the
Island. Accompanied by my master&rsquo;s
son and several others, I went to the
hut where Lay lived, and we had the
pleasure of another interview; but it
was of short duration, for we were not
allowed to be together more than a
quarter of an hour. I returned to my
master&rsquo;s canoe, and there continued till
the middle of the day; we then launched
and set sail for <i>Tabanawort</i>, where
we arrived the fore part of the night.&mdash;Early
next morning we prepared for a
fishing cruise, had pretty good success,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and returned just before night, made a
fire, cooked some fish, and ate a delicious
supper.</p>

<p>Our canoe being leaky and very much
out of repair, my master and I commenced
taking her to pieces, for the purpose
of re-building her; and we were
occasionally employed upon her nearly
two months, when we launched her, and
commencing fishing business, had alternately
good and bad success. One day
we had the good fortune to enclose, in a
kind of wear made for the purpose, a
large quantity of fishes, and with a
scoopnet we caught a plentiful supply.
After cooking them, we set out with a
quantity to dispose of to the chiefs of
Milly, where we arrived before night,
on the same day of sailing. Very soon
after our arrival I saw Lay and his master
approaching the canoe, and we once
more had a short but pleasant interview.
I inquired of Lay how he fared, as to
food, &amp;c. His reply was, better than
he expected, and that the natives were
kind to him, always giving him his part.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
I informed him I had a basket of fish reserved
for him as a present, which he
requested me to keep till dark, that he
might be enabled to carry them home
without having them all begged by the
natives. He came at night for the fish,
and I retired, agreeably to my master&rsquo;s
wishes to sleep in the canoe, to prevent
the natives from stealing the remainder
of the fish that were on board. The
next morning my master was highly
pleased to find that nothing was missing;
and gave me liberty to go and see Lay.
I went to the hut and found him with
his master. They gave me a cordial
welcome, and presented me with some
cocoanuts in return for the fish. Lay&rsquo;s
master inquired of me very particularly
respecting my master, and the quantity
of fish we caught. I then returned to
the canoe, carrying the cocoanuts, to
deposite in the hold. My master asked
me where I got them; I told him Lay&rsquo;s
master gave them to me. If this minute
detail should appear unimportant to the
reader, he may draw a moral from it;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
for it evinces that my master was like
other masters, desirous to know if his
servant came honestly in possession of
the cocoanuts. He then ordered me
and his son to launch the canoe, which
we did, got under sail for the Island we
left the day before, and arrived back at
night. We learned that during our absence
the natives had caught a considerable
quantity of fish; and in a few days
we caught a large quantity more; loaded
our canoe, and embarked for one of
the head Islands to pay a visit, where
we stopped some time. On our return,
we commenced catching a kind of fish
called by the natives <i>kierick</i>. They
are about the size of a small codfish;
and the manner of taking them is very
curious&mdash;they make a line of the husk
of cocoanuts, about the size of a cod
line; they then in the canoe pass round
the fish to the windward of the flat,
then lie to till a considerable quantity of
them get on the flat, then square away
by the wind and run down and go round
the flat with this line, and thus catch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
them, men, women, and children being
employed. I have known them catch
one hundred at a draught. The fish
are afraid of the line, and when enclosed,
taken by a scoopnet. After taking
a sufficient quantity, they go on shore
to prepare for cooking them, which is
done by digging a large hole in the
earth, filling it with wood, covered with
stones. The wood is then consumed,
which heats the stones&mdash;the fish are
wrapped in leaves to prevent them from
falling to pieces, then covered with green
leaves, and cooked by the heat of the
stones. About an hour is required to
cook them sufficient for eating. Their
manner of curing fish, is, to split them
and dry them in the sun, without using
salt. Thus cured, they will keep some
time. While we were employed in fishing,
Lay came to the Island, in company
with a native, to visit me; but did
not stay long, for the chief sent for him,
fearing, as I afterwards found out, that
they should lose us. From some hints
that had been dropped, a report had got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
in circulation that my master and Lamawoot,
(Lay&rsquo;s master,) intended to leave
their Islands, and embark for an Island
to the north west, where the king lived,
and carry us with them as a great curiosity.
Lay was carried back to the
chiefs&mdash;the head one sent an express to
my master and Lay&rsquo;s to come and see
him&mdash;they made preparations and set
sail for Milly; where they were closely
questioned respecting their going to
the other Island, &amp;c. &amp;c. They denied
that they had even intimated any
such design; which was false, for I had
frequently heard them talking on the
subject myself, but kept silent, as it appeared
to be a great crime for any to
desert their Islands; and I feared the
consequences of making it known.&mdash;They
then parted in peace and friendship,
and I and my master returned to
our habitation.</p>

<p>We then went to an Island to catch
fish, and a disagreement taking place
between two of the natives, about some
trifling affair, the particulars of which I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
did not learn, one of them took a spear
belonging to the other, and after breaking
it across his knee, with one half of it
killed his antagonist, and left him. The
parents of the man killed, being present,
laid him out on some mats, and appeared
to regret their loss very much. They
kept a continual drumming over the
body of the deceased for two or three
days; after which he received a decent
burial on another Island at some distance
from the Island where he was killed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p>Having a successful fishing voyage,
we loaded our canoe, and carried our
cargo to the chiefs of <i>Luguonewort</i>. I
had the satisfaction of an interview with
Lay; but our provisions being soon exhausted,
we were obliged to go again in
search of fish. At this time there was
a severe drought, and breadfruit trees
suffered extremely, many of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
entirely died. The superstitious natives
supposed the drought was sent upon
them as a judgment, because myself and
Lay were allowed to live. I informed
them that we could neither make it rain
nor prevent it; but some of them were
so ignorant that they believed we could
control the weather. But some of the
chiefs thought the drought was visited
upon them because they had killed our
shipmates, and I was always ready to
join with them in that opinion. The
drought continued about four months
with such severity that most of the
breadfruit trees on the small Islands
were so completely dried up that they
never sprouted again. Many of the ignorant
natives still insisted that their
sickness and drought were occasioned
by suffering us to live upon their Islands;
but this gross ignorance was
counterbalanced by most of the chiefs,
who believed differently, and to their
more liberal opinion we are indebted
for our lives.</p>

<p>About this time the Islands were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
refreshed by plentiful showers of rain, and
the natives assembled at Milly to sing
for the breadfruit to come in abundance.
They said their singing would please
<i>Anit</i>, and that he would reward them
with a very great crop.</p>

<p>A disturbance existed between the
high chief and his brother <i>Longerene</i>.
The disagreement lasted about nine
months, during which time the two
brothers did not see or speak to each
other. <i>Luttuon</i>, the high chief, then
sent a canoe to inform his brother <i>Longerene</i>
that he wished to see him. An
interview took place, and a treaty of
peace was ratified.</p>

<p>During our stay at Milly, I had frequent
opportunities of seeing Lay, my
fellow sufferer; but the only relief we
could afford each other was derived from
a sympathy of feelings, and in conversations
relating to our homes and native
country, by blending our mutual wishes
for a safe return, &amp;c. &amp;c. The reader
can hardly conceive the unpleasantness
of our situation at this time&mdash;the famine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
was so great that the tender branches
of trees were cooked, and the nutricious
juice drank as food. My strength
was so reduced in consequence of being
deprived of my usual quantity of provisions,
that I was unable to accompany
my master on a fishing voyage. When
my master returned, he found me lying
in the hut, and asked me what was the
matter. I informed him my indisposition
proceeded from hunger; he cooked
a fish and gave me, which, though it
afforded me some relief, was not half enough
to satisfy the cravings of appetite.</p>

<p>After I had recruited my strength,
one day while engaged in fishing, a canoe
came to the Island; and as soon as
the canoe was near enough for the natives
in her to be heard, they commenced
hallooing and making dreadful noises,
which is their practice when war is
declared. They informed us that the
high chief had killed several of the lower
chiefs who belonged to the Island
called Alloo; that <i>Longerene</i> had fled to
Alloo, his own Island; and that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
high chief was determined to pursue
and kill him. We were ordered to go
immediately to his assistance; accordingly
we set sail for the Island Milly,
where we found a great number of natives
collected for war. Again I had
the satisfaction of being with Lay; who
informed me that they were going to
fight the other party at Alloo; and that
the high chief had told him that he and
I must prepare two muskets, and go and
fight with them. Luttuon sent for me
and Lay, and informed us he was about
to have a battle, and that we must prepare
to take a part in it. We asked
him if he had any powder&mdash;he said he
had a plenty, and showed us a small
box, which contained a little powder
and mustard seed mixed together, which,
if it had been good powder, would not
have made more than five or six charges.
We told him it was good for nothing;
but he said we must do the best
we could with it. As we were afraid
to offend him, we went to work with the
powder, and dried it in the sun, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
prepared our muskets for battle.&mdash;The
next morning we launched 15 or 16
canoes, containing in all about 200 natives,
and set sail for Alloo; where we
arrived and landed, and proceeded to a
village in order to give battle to the enemy.
On learning that the chief of Alloo
and his family had fled in a canoe,
we returned to our canoes, made sail in
pursuit of the chief, but did not overtake
him. After returning and spending a
day or two at the Island of Alloo, we
launched our canoes and went to our
respective homes, and heard no more
of the war.</p>

<p>Some time after my master returned
to the Island where we usually resided,
a canoe came and brought the information
that a vessel was anchored near
one of the head Islands&mdash;that she carried
guns on each side, and had a hundred
men&mdash;that they (the natives that
brought the news) had been on board
of the vessel, and received presents of
beads, which they had on their necks.
The natives said the vessel was not like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
our ship which we came in, but had only
two masts. I told them we had vessels
of all descriptions, some with one
mast only. They said the men on board
did not look like us, and that they were
very saucy. I informed the natives the
vessel was a war vessel, and that if molested
by the natives, they would shoot
them. The natives said they would
take the vessel and kill all the men on
board. I told them their safety consisted
in friendship, and that any hostile
attack on the crew of the schooner
would lead to their own destruction.&mdash;They
then set sail for Milly, to inform
the chiefs of the arrival of the vessel at
the head Island. The chiefs of Milly
gave orders to launch the canoes, 15 in
number, to go and take the schooner.
These canoes were manned by 200 natives.
My master&rsquo;s canoe not being in
perfect repair, we could not join the
party. On the night of the 25th, (Nov.)
we saw several of the canoes returning
towards the Island where I was. From
one of the canoes landed the high chief,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
who began to question me respecting
the vessel. I told him I had not seen
the vessel, and of course could not tell
much about her; but that I expected
she had come after me and Lay, and
that she would have us. He then said
he had better kill us both, and then there
would be no one to tell that the natives
had killed the rest of our crew. I told
him that the people on board the schooner
knew there were two alive, and if
they killed us, the crew of the vessel
would kill all the natives. This appeared
to perplex his mind, and he shortly
left me, and retired to rest.</p>

<p>On the next morning, 26th, the chief
again questioned me respecting the vessel,
but I could give him no particular
information, as I had not seen her.&mdash;The
natives then commenced knotting
up leaves to inquire of their god, who,
they said, would inform them what was
best to be done. Towards night they
departed, leaving me with my master,
giving him strict orders not to let me
go to the vessel, fearing that I should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
not only remain on board, but give information
that my shipmates had been
murdered. I was glad to see them depart,
for I feared they would kill me.&mdash;The
reader can have but a faint idea of
my feelings at that time; nor will I attempt
to describe them.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the next day,
(27th,) a canoe came to the Island which
had been boarded by a boat from the
schooner. The natives offered the men
in the boat some cocoanuts, which they
would not accept. The boat then proceeded
towards the Island of Milly.&mdash;The
natives informed me that the men
in the boat inquired after the men who
were left there by the ship Globe; but
they would not give any information
where they were. The canoe left the
Island, and we went to rest. The next
day passed without hearing any thing of
the schooner; but the day following,
(29th of Nov.) as I was walking in the
woods in the afternoon, I heard a dreadful
outcry for Hussey. I ran to the hut
to learn the cause, and to my unspeakable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
joy, I discovered that one of the
schooner&rsquo;s boats was on the beach,
waiting for me, the men all armed and
equipped for battle. As I approached,
the Lieutenant spoke to me and told me
to come to him. I went and sat down
by him. He asked me several questions,
but my feelings were so overcome
and agitated, that I know not whether
I replied in English, or the language of
the natives. While we were sitting together,
the old man whom I had always
called master, but who was now willing
to be considered my servant, asked me
if the white people were going to kill
him. The Lieutenant inquired of me
to know the purport of the old man&rsquo;s
question; I told him he was afraid of
being killed. The Lieutenant replied
that he should not be hurt, if he behaved
himself properly.</p>

<p>We then walked round the Island,
and I collected what few things I had, a
musket, &amp;c. and made preparations for
our departure. My old master being
unwilling to part with me, asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
permission to go with me. I spoke to the
Lieutenant on the subject, and he readily
consented. We then set sail, accompanied
by my master and his son.
We soon fell in with the 2d Lieutenant,
in another boat, who informed that all
the survivors of the Globe&rsquo;s crew were
now rescued. The boats soon lost sight
of each other, as night came on, and
that in which I was arrived at the Island
about 9 o&rsquo;clock in the evening. We
landed, cooked supper, and anchored
our boat at a little distance from the
shore for the night.</p>

<p>The next morning, (30th,) we got
under weigh, accompanied by the other
boat, beat to the windward, for the outside
passage, and then ran down to the
schooner, and got along side at 9 o&rsquo;clock.
I will leave it for the reader, to
picture my feelings on entering once
more on board of an American vessel,
after having been among unmerciful
savages 22 months. We soon had some
breakfast, after which my hair was cut,
which was of two year&rsquo;s growth, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
was furnished with clothing, and remained
on board till the next day.</p>

<p>From this date to the time of our arrival
in the United States, all the important
incidents and facts which transpired,
will be found in the preceding pages,
arranged from the journal kept by
Lay.</p>

<p>After expressing my thanks to all who
assisted to rescue us from savage bondage,
and my gratitude to Heaven for a
safe return to my friends and native
land, I bid the reader a respectful farewell.</p>
